  I was aware of many concepts of this book through the web site of the author jamesclear.com  In fact that the place from where I came to know James first time.  The article on habits where he mentions process is important than goals was my starting point.  I continued reading his updates through the consistent newsletter he publishes through his site.Once the book was announced and available it was a no brainer for me to purchase my own copy to have all the concepts in one place and to go through the ideas in succession.This book provides supplementary material like cheat sheet and templates which are very useful for planning your own habit profile and continuous improvement.This book is action oriented.  The concepts present an action plan for trying them in your own situation and to practice the ideas directly in day to day life.  This makes the book an instruction manual for nurturing good habits and killing bad habits.  I was able to immediately relate to many new habits to start and many not so good habits I can stop and avoid using the identification pattern provided in the book.The principle presented in the book about understanding who to become, that is finding out what identity to achieve instead of just starting or stopping a habit is very helpful.One important aspect of this book is the to the point summary provided after every chapter.  Once you have read the book this summary helps recall all the concepts in short time and becomes a concise model to revise the concepts.The book is engaging and is suitable for reading cover to cover as it provides many stories and references.  As the concept of process than goals was already known to me through the Learning How to Learn MOOC at Coursera, I was glad to find the same concept mentioned in this book and was able to relate quickly with the principles.The book also becomes a workbook and reference material once you have gone through it.  The chapters are divided into sections which can be referred for particular situation in hand.I will recommend this book for anyone who is eager to understand why habits are formed and how to nurture good habits and avoid bad ones.

  And I absolutely mean it what I said in Headline of my comment. I have been following jamesclear.com from very long.His one article has absolutely changed my life, imagine what this book can offer to you.I have been chasing to build many habits and experimenting with them a lot but I would always find a bit difficult to stay with my changed behavior and then while browsing on internet studying more on habits formation I stumbled on James's articles and boy this guy has the answer for habit formation.If you are looking to form a new habit you have to read this Book.I have never commented online on any of the books that I have read but this one deserves a lot of appreciation.This one is for you James, in future if you ever read this comment I want to tell you that your work has hugely impacted my life. And I express my huge gratitude towards your work on Atomic Habits and the articles you post. Thank a lot for this :)

  Before starting this book, write down some good habits you want to build and some bad habits you want to break. This book is filled with practical steps and examples. Yes, there are plenty of habit-building books out there (just as there are plenty of diet books but yet there are still more new books published every year). Plenty of people are seeking the right book that resonates with them. The key points in this book are:* Compound Effect - Very small changes over time will have a big impact.* Habit Building Techniques - Make good habits into routines; use positive reinforcements and other techniques outlined in the book.* Monitor and Measure - Keep track of your progress and improvements.

  I bought the book because it is a bestseller and had great reviews but when I was discussing it with my partner, I was asked a series of interesting questions.If there was ever an easy and proven way to change all bad old habits or add any new good habit, why the best-known minds in Psychology like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung were addicted to smoking, along with best ever physicist Albert Einstein? And if someone has found an easy and proven way to build only good habits and break all bad habits recently then why it is not suggested by all doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists and why the inventor of such a critical thing has not given Nobel price in Physiology or Medicine as it would prevent so much premature death and suffering? How the claim of the author “guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible” can be possible when the human brain is so complicated, that still we understand only a little about it today? Also, can Albert Einstein or all other minds improve 1% every day for their whole life?I found all questions valid and the idea of the book deceptive. I soon came to know that habits are hardwired in the brain and to remove all old habits forever would mean physically removing all the corresponding neural circuits. What one can do however is to develop a new habit that can counter or control the old habit and it will take time and practice. But again, behaviors can be primed and automatically activated from the internal or external cues and it can get extremely convoluted because of endless other genetic, psychological, biological, neural, social, environmental, computational and rest of the known and unknown natural factors related to the human brain. It is wrong to say that we all can break all bad habits forever and add only good ones and it is even harder to decide what is good and what is bad.Identical twins are not exactly the same even when they have the same genes as it is the gene-environment interaction that shapes us and makes each of us unique. Many can obviously break some old bad habits and many can obviously build new good habits but not all can stop all bad habits and not all can install all good habits. And not all can decide what is good and bad. If that would be the case then the world will become perfect in an instant – we all know what is good and bad and we all do it.Also if you are already at a peak, 1% improvement every day will compound to extreme new heights in a few years which is not practical for a brain that is bounded. If you are at the bottom, you can improve 1% every day for a few days but it is not sustainable. Information processing and storage of the nervous system is limited and it just cannot improve 1% every day, for the whole life. It is just not possible. No player always plays his or her best we generally tend to oscillate around the mean. If Einstein improved 1% every day he would have invented endless other new theories. At times we can improve a lot in a few days but not always and not every day.I was suggested book cognitive fitness by my partner earlier but it is was a little bit complicated for me and now I can understand why. The human brain itself is complicated.I am not sure about habits, but the author has sure found an easy way to make money.I may post more on this as I learn more about the behaviors.

  Many of you will find this book very simple and that's what the whole idea is about ,KEEP IT SIMPLE.In this book James talks about habits and that to very small habits which are not even worth noticing but will give you sudden results.When ever we want to start something new we always set a goal that seems to be un achievable ,for example if you want to loose weight you give your self a target of 5 kg or 10 kg and that seems to be very difficult so better start with half a kilo ,that might sound funny but with every half a kilo lost it will turn out to be 5 - 10 kg in few months and with every half a kilo lost you will feel a sense of pride and accomplishment in short run which you could not have experienced if your goal was 5 kg.Make it small make it easy make it attractive that's what the idea is about.One thing that I really liked the most is the concept of habit stacking . When ever you are starting something new don't plan a seperate time schedule for it but just stack it with your current habit.Example - When ever you are going to eat just do 2 pushups before that ,when ever you wake up in the morning just do 2 situps or meditate ,just before sleep read for 10 min etc.By applying this habit stacking I am able to exercise /meditate/read on a daily basis.It all started with 2 pushups to 20 ,from 2 situps to 40 ,from reading 10 min to hours of reading.--I was always lazy so I never exercise ,after reading this book I made it easy ,I fixed my exercise band to one leg of the bed so when ever I used to  go to sleep or I wake up in the morning or I pass by it- I exercise.--I was always eating like my moto was "" eat till you sleep"" so as the author says self control is very difficult for everyone to better make the things you want to avoid INVISIBLE ,so I gave away all the snacks and extra food stuff I had in my home and un installed food delivery apps and guess what it worked but yes you will still need some self control for not buying food stuff and installing food delivery apps.-- I was a social media addict always on my mobile so I made it DIFFICULT , uninstalled all the social media apps and before doing that temporarily disable my account.-- Had an habit of over spending and buying worth less stuff and just filling up the closest, so I pleaged not to spend a single penny untill and unless it's absolutely necessary and I started tracking my spendings on a daily basic.Smaller the target easier it is to achieve and more you do it ,it becomes a habit and habit transforms into big results. Just as every substance has a boiling point which is reached slowly and gradually after continuous heating ,so it needs to reach at a particular temperature before it boils,these small habbits are your continuous heating and sooner or later they will give you results ,Big Results.What changed for me after reading this book?1 I exercise daily and now I am in shape.2 I read on a daily basis.3 Binge eating almost stopped.4 More focused.Hope this helps..

  This book is about how one can build good habits and break the bad ones. It is an extremely practical book so all that is mentioned can be applied in real life. Also, the advanced tactics given in the end were like icing on the cake. If followed, results are GUARANTEED! My least favourite part was the introduction that made me procrastinate reading this book for weeks! But somehow I gathered strength to read further and then realised that it isn't really that bad. I broke some of my bad habits and am very consistent with the good ones. Thanks to this one and my determination ofc.And about the physical appearance, the cover has a soft matt texture which feels good to hold, the size is big and also convenient at the same time and the font size is just perfect.

  So there are some books that you read and feel a regret as to why you didn’t read them earlier, this is one of those books for me. A remarkable book, and I’ll have to read this again. There is so much for everyone to take from it.Alright here are a few key ideas:1. Work towards  1% better ever day.2. Small habits define you.3. Do things the way you vision your identity to be. So let your identity shape your habits.4. Make good habits attractive, easier and and bad ones impossible and really unattractive.5. Anytime during the day ask yourself if what you are doing will lead you to who you intent to be.6. Environment- Cues have a huge impact, so be very cautious about the cues you give your brain.Overall, James clear’s Atomic habit is a must read for anyone in any field really, and certainly a gift for a lot of my loved ones in coming days.

  How long it would take to make a new habit? Many of us would've come across the famous answer ""It would just take 21 days to cultivate a new habit."" But James easily gets through that question in the early pages of this book by an evident ""threshold"".The author just spots the areas and hits the bull's eye in every single law to form or break a habit. The book is so tempting to know about the human psychology associated with behaviors. Each case study, each example, and each research associated with a particular law is helpful to create a lasting impression on the point that Clear is trying to make.While talking about Diderot with the ""Habit Stacking"" technique he slowly brings the current day behavioral economics. While talking about cues that are dependent on the environmental design, he backs it up with the Netherlands domestic power consumption results. While talking about habit tracking he gives a ""moving-a-paper-clip-from-jar-to-jar"" example. This way of putting things stays with me.Breaking down all the four laws and guiding on how to identify our niches based on trial and error methods that improve the favors of a game we would like to play is simply an eye-opener. I was so impressed with the detailed walkthrough of the ""explore and exploit"" method.If this book had just spoken about habit building, it would've been just another self-improvement book available. Instead, it just expanded the vision on why we need to build a retrospective approach behind the habits we wanted to cultivate at the end. It's equivalent to removing the tiny pebbles in our shoes before we climb the mountain.His simplicity throughout the book leaves me to grasp the point ""never stop making improvements"".We need to give this book to school and college students which would allow them to travel in the path of mastery.After all, Steve Jobs said,  ""In the first 30 years of your life, you make your habits. For the last 30 years of your life, your habits make you.""Recommend it? Must read!

  There are some books which are feel good books, and there are books which practical books. Atomic habit is one such insanely practical book which can be applied in life the moment you started reading this book. I remember a similar book I read a few years back 'The Power of Habit' by Charles Duhigg. I would say this book is a easier version than the power of habit book. Concepts are moreover similar in both the books. This book is just written in way so that it's easy to apply the learnings from the book of n daily life. The four key things for forming habits cue, craving, response, reward are discussed in detail in separate chapters. If you are looking for a great book  on habit formation read this one first and then you can read 'The Power of Habit' book. Only thing I felt extra and not required is the last one or two chapters. The book could have been shorter. The reason I didn't rate it five star is because already another excellent book has been written on the similar topic by Charles Duhigg

  I am not really a person interested in self-help books but this book has changed that notion of mine.The author gives real life examples before the start of each chapter which I found really interesting. For me, this book isn't just about habits or how to develop good habits and discard bad ones, but it is more about understanding 'why we behave the way we behave'. The author gives four laws of behaviour change and each law provides a set of rules to create good habits and break bad ones. The laws are explained in detail giving a lot of examples.Also, this book is filled with so many inspiring quotes! I love reading quotes when I feel low or demotivated and this book has so many good quotes. They are definitely going on the whiteboard in my study room!Some of my favorite ones are:When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it.Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible.It's crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope.The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least.Happy reading!

  ATOMIC HABITSIt’s too early to tell if it’s an effective book; but it sure is an inspiring one. Its appeal lies in making good habits seem so easily attainable. It highlights the power of tiny changes; of getting 1% better every day. Like, it’s better to exercise for two minutes than to not exercise at all. It’s better to read just one page than to not read at all. Or for bad habits, try smoking one cigarette less even if you can’t quit smoking altogether. It illustrates how a single and simple change can turn into a good habit; like by changing your environment to reduce friction towards the desired habit - place a bowl of fruits on your study table than storing it out of sight. Or signing up at a gym close to your place than one off route. It encourages locking your decisions before you give in to temptation. A lot of these tricks seem obvious and known; but entirely doable!The author, James Clear draws from the Japanese philosophy of Kaizen: micro changes, from Physics: the path of least resistance, from Biology: the response of our brains to instant gratification, etc. The drawback of the book, I felt, lies in that it lays a better roadmap for building good habits than for kicking bad ones.That said, after reading the book, I have begun going for a walk; remains to see how long I continue :)

  One of the best books I ever read on Self Help. This is definitely going to end up on my top 10 books in the self-help category. The book clearly states why we do by getting into the bones of it. The tools and strategies given are very sensible and easy to apply. This book is a must-read for all those people who wonder why they are slacking when doing the things that matter to them most. It also addresses why motivation does not last long and how we need to keep going even when motivation does not exist. The book also depicts graphically how everything we do eventually adds up in the end and why people give up when they don't see the results.If you need a clear blueprint on how to change old habits and stick to new ones and understand the science behind habits and systems that create them this is a must-read.

If just 2 chapters created in me a new outlook on my lifestyle n habits then I'm 100% sure after completing this I'll become substantially better in carrying out my daily tasks and become a better version of myself.

  I regret reading it so late in my life. Things would have been very different had i read it earlier. Going to finish it for 5th times (roughly,  including Audible listens).Best thing i got from it is that i changed my going to bad habit which i was struggling for years. Basically I got main idea from a chapter mentioning immediate financial reward saving. I created a box and put some amount in it next day if i go to bed by certain time and deduct some amount form it otherwise.Must read for all.

  Possibly the best book I've read about building habits and more importantly, sustaining them. Clear is absolutely splendid in the way he breaks down habits into easily digestible concepts rather than those that strike fear. If you've struggled with getting off the ground with any habit, I recommend this book to you. His personal anecdotes add weight to the tips and the anecdotal evidence is fantastic.

  This book would most suit the person who has tried time and again but failed to cultivate certain habits or the young hopeful, all the same.  It is not going to teach you to succeed in your goal. It'll point you to the right set of systems that might sustain your habit.The author, true to his surname, is very clear in the way he has progressed through the book. Each chapter is a beautiful extension of the previous one like how a water droplet follows another that makes a beautiful waterfall. Very well structured and thought through that it could well be a thriller.Another aspect of technique that i love about this book is the way each chapter opens. It's always with an example from a different field of profession - sports, operations, advertising, philosophy and so on. This makes you relate to the problem he's discussing in the chapter and the eventual solution. It gives a bigger canvas to grapple with the concept.Things that could have been better -- If you are someone very young and have not failed in anything before -  not everything in the book is for everyone. There are things that might work and some might not. The author also makes this disclaimer albeit a little late in the book.If you are searching for techniques to abstain from a bad habit then you'll be disappointed. This book doesn't have much on that front.  There are some pointers but not as detailed as the positive habit building techniques.

  Whether you are a victim of procrastination or struggling with your routine; whether you are a victim of bad habits or struggling to quit them; then Atomic Habits by James Clear, a consummate professional in behavioral psychology and habit formation, is the best self-help book for you. This book can make a huge difference that manifests remarkable results when practically applied to our life.It is divided into six parts- from fundamentals to advance tactics- which could provide a proven framework with examples, and step-by-step methods for making good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying and bad habits invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying. Every chapter has its summary for the readers to recall the important points in the chapter whenever they need.This book provides supplementary cheat sheets, templates, a journal that are very useful for the practical implementation of various ways and techniques mentioned in this book.I also discovered, at first to my consternation and then to my pleasure, that how basic factors, that are often underrated, are responsible for the formation of habits and making them long-lasting.The read is exceptionally interesting and flowing. I've completed this book within a week and, to my better understanding, I jotted down notes in my journal to implement them in my day-to-day life. After reading this book, I've been truly inspired by James Clear's work that I even subscribed to his Newsletter and 30 Days To Better Habits on JamesClear.com.I would highly recommend this exponentially self-improvement book to everyone.Life-changing Book5⭐️

  It is a must read if you are even a little bit motivated to work on yourself. The book gives you that little trigger you need, that little push to start a great journey. If you want to achieve something in life but you are clueless about where to start, then this is the book for you. It is not about general quotes that tell you to do hard work. Rather, the author gives logical and rational methods for you to move ahead in your life.Four stars because towards the end of it, I started to get distracted and bored and didn’t really read thoroughly. Maybe because I was successful in getting my habits on track and my purpose was fulfilled. Anyway, I would totally recommend it!

  Great book clearly list out the problems which we face when we want to change our lives. It very distinctly mentions with detail the points because of which we fail and why we fail on them. The author has very accurately mentioned the various methods by which we can change ourselves and ultimately our lives. But after a couple of months reading it and trying out the techniques mentioned I find myself standing right where I started. After reading many other self help books from famous authors ,watching numerous videos on YouTube I am coming to a conclusion that it doesn't matter how many books have you read ,how many videos have you watched ,how many techniques you applied, until you know your WHY. Those who have already read different books on the subject would understand and those who have just started will understand when they are ready.Overall for the book I would say it's a great book which hits right on point. It's a must read for everyone who are trying to change. And it's a must read for those who have just started their journey on the subject.

  This book is a must read for anyone & everyone as it talks about building good habits by taking small steps and the ways in which we can stick to those good habits for the long term (It is very easy to drift towards bad habits even after pursuing some good ones because there are so many distractions or simply because our motivation level drops after a few days of following good habits. After all sticking to good habits requires a lot of effort and self control). This book talks about how build such habits which help you develop into a better person and also make those habits interesting so that we do not lose the motivation to continue with them.The packaging from the seller however was a disappointment.

  James did a terrific job of knowledge synthesis in this book and Manson's approval of it as ""a supremely practical and useful book"" is not an overstatement.The author has ended my lifelong search of how to make habits stick, with his masterful display of four magic laws, and I am finding the book a nugget of wisdom.To me the book's premise (not necessarily the author's statement) is simple: If you want to get to your goal, change your systems, which are nothing but our habits. In other words your goals are defined by your tiny habits, and by corollary, your habits create your goals.By doing exercise daily you create a healthy you, but by smoking daily you create the goal of getting terminal illness. Habits are the foundation of the self.Mr. Clear, you've transformed me, down to the atomic scale, for good.

   The page quality is too thin to be an original. The book looked like it was used, prior to being delivered. New books have tight binding but this one has looser binding so it was either used before or poorly made. I have ordered a replacement. Amazon should have stricter quality control standards with sellers and not allow them to sell subpar quality products. This quality of this book is like the books that are sold by second hand sellers. Buy this book from a bookstore instead of Amazon.UPDATE : I have received the replacement. This time they sent a new, good quality book. The pages in this replacement copy are regular good quality pages that one might find in a book bought from the bookstore and the binding is tight as well. Due to this prompt action, I am increasing the rating from 1 star to 4 stars. I don't have any doubts regarding the quality of content of this book as it was a highly recommended read.

  By meta analysis I mean that the author has gone through most of the literature, studies and analysis of how habits form and what it really mean to have a habit that is engraved with your identity. He himself uses the tools and techniques that he talks about and really gives the whole picture when it comes to habit formation. Although I have not read any other habit formation books but I firmly believe that if you read this one it should be sufficient.In short a good one if you are interested in the topic.

  I have been reading your articles for ~4 years and having interest in psychology i was able to grasp most of the topics that i read and it helped me a lot to get a hold of my life, decisions and many other areas of life.This book can be said as the golden extract of all those articles.This book is very helpful and very logical, especially for students and those who are working and yet feel like something is amiss.This is not like most of without logic just adrenaline pumped motivational books or videos.In one sentence - If you are/want to be a mature, reasonable and understanding person you will treasure this book.

  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I find the content to be pragmatic but yet motivating. This is where author has really scored very high. While some of the mechanisms like stacking up habits, priming the environment for next use etc. are things we have known sub consciously, authors narrates them nicely, and brings this to our awareness. ""The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom"" and the quote earlier in the book on time magnifying whatever we feed in atomically are very profound. I'm going to put these mechanisms into use to develop a new habit - ""to become a better reader"".

  This is the best ever practical book understanding the basic human behaviour for forming new habits. I know now that goal doesn't matter its just practising daily even if its 1% . The four laws are pretty much understable and its a book that should read continuously again and again to completely absorb what james really want to say.

  Power-packed insights with evidence. Unlike other self help books, James proposes a method to tackle the root of the problem. The key idea is that forming a good habit needs a powerful initiator and to sustain, it needs to be easy and simple. Starting small and delivering on it, will get the ball rolling eventually towards larger goals. The book is ""clear"" and every idea is reinforced by examples and real life situations.I have begun to try some of the techniques and hope it all works out eventually. Will update the review later.

And I wanted to share the notes and ideas which helped me with you all.The crux of the book is that Habits are the compound interest of self improvement.  The effects of your habits multiplies as you repeat them just like money.  A simple change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.According to James Clear,  all habits revolves around the below four step model and any behavior change revolves around these steps.CueCravingResponseRewardAggregation of Marginal gains:It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What really matter is whether your habits are putting you in the right path to success. Instead of focusing on your current results, you should you concerned with your current trajectory. Your aim should be to become 1% better everyday. Winning tiny battles like hitting the gym each week, reading books each day and spending less than you earn each month will define your future.Can 1 % improvement really make any difference?Habits often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. People make few small changes and when they fail to see immediate results, they quit. This is the prime reason why people struggle to build habits that lasts.Mastery require patience. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiple whatever you feed it. Good Habits makes time your ally and Bad habits make time your enemy.Habits and Identity:The more pride you have in a particular aspects of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. James argues that identity is literally your “repeated being”. The frequency of your habits influence your identity and vice versa. The goal is NOT to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.Two step process:Decide the type of person you want to be.Prove it to your self with small wins.The First Law:Create a habit scorecard:Make a list of your daily habits.Once you list, look at each habits and ask yourself “Is this a good/bad or a neutral habit?.  Assign ‘+’ if its a good habit, ‘-‘ for bad habit and ‘=’ for neutral habit.Design your environment:Environment is the invisible hand that shapes your behavior. If you want to make a behavior change, make a cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behavior will usually have multiple cues.Habit Stacking:Best way to build a new habit is to identity a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.The Second Law:We need to make our habits attractive so learn to associate them with positive experience. Sometimes all you need is a slight mind-set shift.The Third Law:If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You just need to practice it often. The more you repeat an activity, the more structure of your brain changes to become efficient at it. Example: Learn a new language, play an instrument require repetition.Two minutes rule:When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.Example: Read before bed each night becomes “Read one page”. Run three miles becomes “take out my running shoes”.The Fourth Law:What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished it avoided. Reward yourself after every new habit. Take a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk.Never miss twiceYou don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. So always show up.Create a Habit contract:Create a habit contract with you partner or your friend. This will help you stay the course.These are some of the best points I have found helpful from the book. Let me know if you have found other great tips for habit building.If you are looking for more Habit hacks, then I recommend that you follow James clear on twitter.

  Tiny Changes, Remarkable ResultsAtomic Habits by James ClearThe very title and the logline inserted with it provide enough glimmer on the theme of this book by James Clear. It is not only about forming good habits but also about eroding the bad ones. And the process allotted in this course of habit formation is superbly explained and illustrated by the writer not only in words and explanation, but also in multiple example and diagram.The book starts with an introduction, blood smitten and horrible. As a student of the sophomore year of high school the author met a horrible accident while playing baseball when a bat in a full swing struck his face and devastated it. Living with the post traumatic seizures and bulged eye ball from the socket, it took several months and years to survive, “…day faded into night… a series of machines kept me alive.” It was a real fight, and he took it as his challenge to come back to the life, “And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible for making it happen.” And he “…discovered the surprising power of small habits for the first time.”“…changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.” “With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.”“Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. 1% BETTER EVERY DAY 1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03 1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78.” Wow! How he explains everything in a mathematical way and pragmatically. We also get acquainted with many reputed theorists in the field of psychology and behavior like Thorndike, B. F Skinner, Charles Duhigg etc. and focus on the integrated model of cognitive and behavioral sciences and habit formation.“Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.”Every chapter, every line carries a message as strong as the fleeting arrow, just … from the bow. They fill the heart with strong conviction, deliberate motivation.  Good habit is the source of self control and only a self controlled person can enjoy the life avoiding the trapping of tangled …he introduces us with the four steps of a habit formation - cue, craving, response and reward. Forget about goals and stay focused on system instead.Every line is spirited, and how my fingers etched on the keyboard to copy each and every line of it. The chapter summery again helps a lot to sum up and revise what5 we learn throughout the chapter. It’s a discrete choice of style on his pert and obviously a prudent one. He focuses on building a system and then a habit, “…do not build outcome based habits. But build identity – based habits.” He also gives importance on the ‘belief’, “… if you cannot change your underlying beliefs you cannot change your habits.”And “true behavior change is identity change.”How he became a writer,” I did not start out as a writer. I became one through my habits.” He assures us that “process of habit formation begins with trial and error,” “walk slowly but never backward” and the Goldilocks Rule.This is a book, not just to go through and stock in your book self, but a guide for everyday life, a friend in every adversity.

  Overall, I would say that this is a good book.I like the first sections the most. The most critical insight that I got from the book is the one where James Clear asks the reader to change the narrative if he – or she – wants to change. He gave the example of a smoker trying to quit smoking. He suggested that a smoker should say that he is not a smoker and not that he is trying to leave the habit. This example provides us with a powerful insight.The methodology that he has suggested to adopt a good habit – or give up a bad one – is excellent.From there on, the book tends to become repetitive. The repetition detracts from the value of the book.It is a book that is worth reading.

  This book just climbed to the top as my most favourite self-help non-fiction of the year!Totally engaging and quite convincing in how the book makes you want to change your bad habits and adopt good ones, this book doesn't talk in a way to make you feel overwhelmed or make you feel like everything you do is wrong or inadequate.The book doesn't give you impractical tips yet it tells stories and what to learn in how to gradually maintain habits that would benefit you in the long run as well as how to start maintaining habits that you have been wanting to in small practical steps.This book is life-changing for me.I have already adopted some of these tips yet the book makes me realise that there are many things that we do that we consider harmless yet taking up most of our time which make us frustrated in real.The tips are easy to understand and follow. The writing is amazing. I would highly recommend this book.Another 2021 top favourite!🌻

  I had heard really great things about this book, so even going in - I had sky high expectations. And usually that's a terrible thing, because then no matter how good the book is, I can't help feeling slightly let down. Which is crazy, I know!But this was a surprisingly amazing exception. Because not only did it meet all the unrealistic expectations I had - it surpassed them!!It's definitely the best book on habits I've ever read!In-fact I personally found this one to be better than The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, which I believe is more widely known as the go-to book on understanding habits.And okay to be totally fair - The Power of Habit did indeed help me understand how habits are formed, but it was also kind of long winded, and included organizational & societal habits too (things that I personally wasn't interested in).This one on the other hand, was a straightforward guide on habit forming and/or breaking with lots of direct actionable tips and advice geared specifically to the individual.Which is why if this subject even remotely interests you -  GET THE BOOK right away!

  I depend a lot on my habits to be productive and efficient in my personal and professional routines. Habits have helped me get better slightly every day which becomes a lot better in a couple of months. I use habits for learning oil paintings, consistently working out, controlling my diet, gardening and being productive at my work.This started some time back some one year ago - when I overheard a friend telling how he learnt to play the guitar like a pro along with his tough office routine. He just said one thing - ""I played for 15 min. every day without fail for the last four years."".I personally have never like Self-help books - and I was very reluctant when I started reading Atomic Habits. I was afraid that my own resolve and habits that are serving me well may get disrupted. It was a real shock when I realised that I had been unintentionally following many of the recommendations James Clear makes in this book. Most people already know that they should develop good habits - but very rarely they create a system to make these good habits their routine.This book helped me rationalise many of the benefits that I had been observing in myself. This book gave me a context and a story to further convince myself to seriously continue the good habits. It has only strengthened my resolve and has also provided me with more tricks to get better in my habits.The biggest learning was that the same process which I was using to gain new habits could also be used for eliminating bad habits - which I was not focusing on.I would recommend this book for everyone who aspires to be a better version of themselves. But I will also advise everyone who is looking to drop a bad habit - from smoking, eating junk food, social media addiction, wasting time on games etc. to pick up this book once.But more than the book - I will recommend everyone to first internalise that habits can make you better. Happy reading.

  Since I turned thirty five this month, I thought it was about time to incorporate some good habits into my life. I don’t usually do self help books so shall blame this one on a mid-life crisis (assuming I get to live to a ripe old age of seventy!)My biggest takeaway from this book was that good habits are not a function of our will power but our environment - and how that environment can be tweaked a tiny bit at a time so that it becomes easier to practice good habits and a greater effort is required to indulge in poor habits. Because ultimately, humans are wired to take the easier path! Makes a lot of sense.I gave it 4 stars because for  a 5-star rating I need to see a notable difference in my habits. But it’s not you James Clear, it’s me!

  # Book review- Atomic Habits by James ClearWe all can agree that the easier it is to grasp a concept, the higher the prowess of the one imparting it. On the attribute as mentioned, Mr James Clear aces his writing and book. If you have not read any self help books and are willing to take a plunge, this can be a fantastic start.The phenomenal power of small steps compounded over time is presented tactfully in Atomic Habits. What this book brilliantly does is to effectively establish in the reader's mind that even a slight bit of effort towards realising a particular goal, say a habit, can have far-reaching consequences.Mr James uses real-life examples from sports, his personal life, readers’ experience amongst others to drive home the concepts he espouses. This technique adds the charm to the writing.Mr. Clear outlines 4 laws to behaviour change and as mentioned, using examples and science, he makes it easy for the reader to understand and effectively apply it to his/her personal life. I already have begun to make use of some of the brilliant techniques and hacks I learned from this book.It is a must-read for anyone looking to improve their life.

  The surprising power of Atomic Habits : Habits are double edge sword. Habits are like the atoms in our lives. Each one is fundamental unit of that and contribute to the overall improvement. If we get 1 % better each day for one year, we’ll end up thirty seven times better by the time we’re done. This make habits as the compound interest of self-improvement.  The see of every habit is a single tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Habits are not Goals. The goals are about results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that leads to those results. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. Habits shape the identity and a typical framework as mentioned will aid in building them.  They areCue : The cue triggers the brain to initiate a behavior | Craving : These are the motivational force behind every habit.|  Response: The response is actual habit that is performed which take the form of a thought or an action |Reward :  The reward serve two purpose – They satisfy the trigger and they teach.  Reward teach us which action are worth remembering in the future. Behavior is the function of the person in that environment. B=f(P,E), therefore Motivation is overrated; Environment often matters most. Family and Friends in play a major role in  shaping our habits. Habit can be formed either using Goldilocks rule or two minutes rule.A good book to read.

  James Clear tells the reader about the book Atomic Habits in the most effective and succinct way in the blurb: “An easy and proven way to build good habits and break bad ones.”He defines an atomic habit as a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. Atomic habits are part of a larger system. He says the phrase atomic habits means a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power.Right at the book’s beginning Clear explains the fundamentals of atomic habits with a remarkable story of the British cycling team and their coach, Dave Brailsford.Until 2003, when Brailford was appointed as performance director, British cycling had endured mediocrity for nearly a hundred years. The difference was the new coach’s relentless commitment to a strategy he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains.” Simply put it means…searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.Brailford and his coaches broke down everything that goes into riding a bike, and sought to improve them by one percent. Then, when everything is put together, a significant increase in performance is achieved. The coaching team diligently looked into different areas, including unexpected and overlooked ones and came up with one percent improvements. The results came quick and fast:The British cycling team dominated the track cycling events in the 2008 Olympic games, winning a staggering 60 percent of the gold medals. The team continued to dominate and set new records in the next Olympic games. In the next six years, British cyclists went on to win five Tour de France titles.The building of a habit proceeds through four stages, in the same order. The four-step process called the habit loop by Clear is not an occasional one but an endless feedback loop, active and running during every moment of one’s life:Cue- Craving- Response- Reward.The cue triggers one’s brain to initiate a behavior. Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. Without craving a change, one has no reason to act. Response is the actual habit one performs, which can be a thought or action. Reward is the end goal of every habit. It satisfies one’s craving, while teaching which actions are worth remembering in the future.The author transforms the four steps into a practical framework that can be used to design good habits and eliminate bad ones. The framework is called the Four laws of behavior change: 1. Make it obvious (cue), 2. Make it attractive (craving), 3. Make it easy (response), and 4. Make it satisfying (reward).Enroute his exposition of the four laws of behavior change, Clear entertains the reader with inspiring stories, events and theories, seamlessly puts across the laws in the simplest and highly readable way. Here are some interesting revelations: Goals and systems:If you want better results, then forget about setting goals, focus on your system instead. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.-The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.-You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fail to the level of your systems.The Goldilocks rule: How to stay motivated in life and work:The rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.The core idea of the Goldilocks rule: Working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.An excellent example of the Goldilocks rule in practice is the comedy career of American actor, Steve Martin. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine - but only by a minute or two. His victories were just enough to keep him motivated and mistakes, just enough to keep him working hard.Atomic Habits by James Clear, delves into the realm of habits, psychology, neuroscience, delineates steps, nuances and structure as to how to build a better habit as well as how to break a bad habit, build a system for getting 1 percent better every day, overcome lack of motivation and willpower and much more. Backed by copious research, notes, references and citations, Atomic Habits is indeed special, engaging and a go-to book.

  Book ReviewTitle: Atomic HabitsAuthor: James ClearPages: 306Reading Difficulty: Easy to readGenre: Self-help bookRating: 5/5About The Book: The book is about how small daily changes can become the difference between who you are and who you want to become. Normally we humans overestimate the value of one big defining moment but it is all those small, tiny improvements that create all the difference.Main Theme: The main theme of this book is how to create good habits and break the bad ones in 4 simple steps (laws)Here are those laws;The 1st Law: Make It Obvious.The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive.The 3rd Law: Make It Easy.The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying.Best Quote from the book: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”My Favorite Lesson: This book has many major learning lessons but I can't tell them all in the review 😅As humans, we set goals to achieve the desired outcomes or results but when we fail, we think that we have set too high expectations for ourselves and we try to change the goals but it's not right, you are failing not because of your goals but because of the system that leads you to that outcomes.So whenever, you fail to get the desired outcome try to change the system through which you get the results.My Thoughts: This book is worth reading, every page and every lesson has Taught me something completely new, which I didn't know earlier. And yes, while reading this book reflect on the earlier times when you were trying to build good habits, you will certainly get a smile 😊😊 on your face and you will get where you were going wrong.Who Should Read This: Every single person, who wants to build good habits and those who have failed in the past from creating that habits and also for those who want to break their bad habits, In short, It's for every person who is trying to become the version of himself. 💪💪Have a Good One,Keep Reading ✌✌.

  I have the audible version of Atomic habits. I bought it with audible credit. Without any unfair spoilers, let me say that this is a book you should listen to if you are struggling with bringing positive changes in your life. It helped me.  You will find that it is repetitive in a way but I think it's in order to feed the idea into your brain through repetition. So I won't really complain about that part.

  Nothing on what to do when the thing you are pursuing is hard and you fail at it. There is no reward to pursue it. How can you build habits in such cases? These are usually the sort of habits you need to develop to be successful.One common thing among successful people is that they never read atomic habits because they know its a waste of time.

  Improving habits is one power. i always thought routine is boredom, but it takes immense perseverance and strength to maintain a lifestyle - be it fitness or business or healthy eating. Doing the same thing over and over, being flexible with ourselves, Habit tracking - James Clear is one wonderful author needed at crucial times. Wonderfully written and a great guide. Would be valuable for students if its included in their curriculum too. Improve habits atomically and Life will be a bomb.

  Like everyone else, I want to get better. I feel if i am more consistent, my effectiveness will increase. Atomic Habits is a great book that helps you identify where the flaws lie. Not just that it tells you more about the need to make little long lasting changes. The author is objective and looking at his past, I am surprised he is as objective as he is. I mean with the help of examples and simple language, he makes you feel as though this book is the holy grail. Let me tell you about some things I loved about this book. The book says the following :-> Fall in love with the process rather than the product. This is important because when you have a goal, it can be so daunting that you will be unhappy all along the journey to it and only getting the goal will make you stop feeling miserable. Dont wait to give yourself permission to be happy.-> It is not about a single accomplishment but it is about a cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Commit to process. The holy grail of havbit change is not a single 1% improvement but a whole bunch of them. It is a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of overall system.-> Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.-> Your identity is literally your repeated beingness.-> acknowledge need of action by saying things aloud-> stressed at work? take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile.I loved how the author does not berate you with a bunch of things you are doing wrong. Instead the author makes most of the pages in the book in explaining to you that if you are not succeeding perhaps you need to make several small changes that add to the aggregate work of your life.I think it has enthused in me infectious energy. It has been 10 days since the book ended but I have been taking more action at work. I have been taking more pains with my diet. I now track my calories. I have been to the gym way more regular. I know I can't afford to ever miss a workout and if I do, then it can't be missed for another day. Even if I go to gym for just 10 minutes the second day.The flaw in the book is how much it tries to stuff into one book.The flaw in the book is that despite being of moderate intelligence, I can't remember all the things and have to refer to the notes.I feel as though the whole book is a waste if the reader does not retain everything.However it is nearly impossible to retain all things in the book without considerable re-visits.That is a good thing. That is a bad thing.Also the cue, craving, response and reward - four laws of behavioural change concept is a complete fail on me.So there you have it. I read this book on paperback but found reading on my kindle and phone more effective. But the print is solid and very good.Also there is plenty of times in the book that the author writes the points he discussed in the chapters. So if you were not paying enough attention, guess what? you get one more chance.Go read it now.

  I previously wrote this review right after reading the book.  Today, February 15th, after applying James’s system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.I will divide the review into 5 parts.  The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes.  Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits.  Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months.  Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book.  Last, there are 4 complementary readings.SUMMARY[Introduction]  James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school.  That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that “we all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.  With the same habits, you will end up with the same results.  But with better habits, anything is possible.”[Section I  :  The Fundamentals][Chapter 1]  Here we learn the power of compounding effect:  changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years.  James explains that “breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.”  Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks.  From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.[Chapter 2]  Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change model—divided into outcome change, process change, and identity change—James explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values.  “Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve.  This leads us to outcome-based habits.  The alternative is to build identity-based habits.  With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.”  The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.[Chapter 3]  In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward.  James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'.  He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior—when the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible.  Through examples, he explains that “the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.”  Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.[Section II  :  Make It Obvious][Chapter 4]  A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes.  Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded.  If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues.  James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'—a simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis.  We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit.  Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.[Chapter 5]  The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location.  When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through.  Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage.  An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: “after I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.”[Chapter 6]  This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors.  “Given that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.”  To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.[Chapter 7]  One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.  As James points out, “it is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.”[Section III  :  Make It Attractive][Chapter 8]  James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.  Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine.  It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action.  “Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive.  The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.”[Chapter 9]  “We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.”  That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues.  There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe.  And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.  One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.[Chapter 10]  To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive.  “Habits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.”[Section IV  :  Make It Easy][Chapter 11]  “All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity.  Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.”  The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.[Chapter 12]  Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy.  By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.  “You don't actually want the habit itself.  What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.  The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.”  That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.[Chapter 13]  There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day.  As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one.  To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action.  “A new habit should not feel like a challenge.  The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy.  What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.”  He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning.  Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.[Chapter 14]  In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place.  There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior.  [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future.  James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served.  If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen.  [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.[Section V  :  Make It Satisfying][Chapter 15]  We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time.  “The human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.”  For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.[Chapter 16]  Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits.  The immediate satisfaction it delivers—as mentioned earlier in Chapter 15—is one of the many benefits that standout.  Besides that, James says, “when we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.”  The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine.  One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows:  “If you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible.  The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.  It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.  Missing once is an accident.  Missing twice is the start of a new habit.  This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers.  Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work.  But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.”[Chapter 17]  In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful.  A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability:  “It is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through.  Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.”[Section VI  :  Advanced Techniques][Chapter 18]  We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities.  “One of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.”  James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.[Chapter 19]  When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest.  The ‘Goldilocks Rule’ states that ""humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.  Not too hard.  Not too easy.  Just right.”[Chapter 20]  One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors.  To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance.  Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that “the process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.”PERSONAL THOUGHTSReading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details.  In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits.  Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the book—following the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.[1]  The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period.  A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month.  Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.[2]  The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month.  In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.[3]  Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high.  It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives.  Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS[Nov 1, 2018]  I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened.  Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journal—a daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time.  Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle.  Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit.  During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.[Dec 1, 2018]  I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement.  Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands.  But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis.  Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method.  This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.[Jan 1, 2019]  By now we know the benefits of cold showers—ranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world.  I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a “goal” mindset instead of a “habit” mindset.  After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode.  Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers.  After all, it is about intention.  Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories.  One of my inspirations was Wim Hof.  It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.Putting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day.  While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.RECOMMENDATION[1]  First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.[2]  However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.[3]  Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.COMPLEMENTARY READINGS[1]  Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next.  The book is divided into 46 laws.[2]  Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most.  This is especially interesting to break bad habits.[3]  The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely.  I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talent—which is perhaps even more to the point.[4]  The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated.  It is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement Atomic Habits especially to tie together the 4-step framework into the feedback loop system.I sincerely hope you, too, have fun while building new habits.Take care,Haical

  This is a wonderful book for tips on how to manage habits. But the author is more of a presenter of information than a clear thinker, and more work is needed to resolve some of the contradictions in his presentation.For example, he uses the term ""habit"" to refer to three quite different things without taking into account the differences: First, what one might call ""unthinking habits,"" such as making coffee first thing in the morning, automatically, no decision required, you just do it without thinking, but there is none of the progressive effect that Clear describes as a virtue of ""habits.""  Unthinking habits are all about economy of effort in routine chores.Second, ""cumulative habits,"" which also don't require a decision or a lot of thought - you just do them, because you have got into the habit - but these result in a cumulative effect over time; for example, exercising after work, which can lead to quite substantial improvements in fitness with a little effort each time over a period of time.Third, what are really ""routines"" rather than habits: for example, writing 10 pages of your novel before breakfast every morning. Once established, these are initiated each time automatically, because that's your time to do X, and they are cumulative (10 pages/day adds up to a complete book at some point), but they are most definitely not unthinking or automatic in their execution.These distinctions are important because the three types of habit need to be handled differently. We don't need to think about automatic habits or even cumulative habits, during the rest of the day. But to make progress with a routine such as writing or any other creative endeavor, a constant mulling over outside the actual time of the routine involvement is essential. The first two are about economy of effort, while the third is about momentum of engagement and reaching a distant target with consistent application over time, but with very little ""economy.""Another point: Clear says initially that we change our habits by changing our beliefs about ourselves (pp. 32-35), but this is manifestly untenable - believing you are a writer is not the same as actually writing a book, nor does mere belief lead to action. So he is forced to shift the narrative to seeing change of self as a matter of acting in a way that creates the person we want to be, by developing the right habits (as Aristotle described this), and there he is on sounder ground. But it would be helpful to the reader if he worked out these untenable lines of thinking beforehand and avoided taking the reader down them altogether.Timothy Corwen (author, The Worth of a Person; https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1790698391/)

  A marketing masterpiece.With all due respect to author's team exceptional ability to better market & monetize original authors' ideas, my two cents is that this is, at its best, a two-page worth of original content which is bulked into an unnecessarily verbose & repetitive three-hundred-something pages book that was mostly a waste of time.The literature not only targets the average Joe out there, but also repeats itself constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. Constantly. And I mean, cons-tant-ly! (I wish this review becomes as successful!)So, to give you the tldr you'd need and save you the trouble:The author reads the Duhig's ""power of habit"" and Eyal's ""hooked"" books and starts summerizing ""his framework"" upon those original ideas. As he mentions himself:""Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special recognition for their influence on this image. This representation of the habit loop is a combination of language that was popularized by Duhigg’s book, The Power of Habit, and a design that was popularized by Eyal’s book, Hooked.""Here's the original content and the framework he proposes:For good habits:- Make it obvious (cue)- Make it attractive (craving)- Make it easy (response)- Make it satisfying (reward)Do the opposite for the bad ones. And he calls it ""The Four Laws of Behavior Change"". And the rest is considerable loads of examples and repeatitions. Yup. Millions of sales. Magic.Yup, it's totally fine to expand & build upon others' ideas. It's how human knowledge grows. But come on, it's just 4 sentences. Ok, add one paragraph explanation per each, one example per each and then one page conclusion and that'd be a nice blog post I'd enjoy.—P.S. Duhig has also introduced a framework himself:

  I bought this book as I listened to an interview with James Clear on a podcast and found him interesting. His book, however was disappointing. It follows the typical self-help formula of common sense and old ideas combined with overly simplistic charts and celebrity anecdotes to remind you of what you already know.That said, sometimes you do need the reminder. And I did pick up a few useful tips. So it’s worth the read. But don’t expect anything special.

  I have been a subscriber of James's email for a number of years and have always thoroughly enjoyed his writing. It's practical, useful and always well presented. As soon as he announced his book, I was straight on Amazon to pre-order. Although it only arrived today, I had the chance to listen to an early audio book copy. It's absolutely superb!This book is as practical as the content of his email newsletters, and I intend on reading (or listening to) this book multiple times over so I can 'extract' as much value from it as possible. He offers background, context, stories and more, to illustrate each of his points. As with all books of this nature, merely listening is not enough; application and implementation is key to gaining value from it.There's a good amount of additional supporting material that you can download too (links are in the book). So you not only get the book to read, but lots of extras to help you make use of what is taught.It's an engaging listen (or read) and comes highly recommended by me! If you're unsure, search online for ""James Clear"", have a read of some of his content, and make a decision.

  OH.MY.GOSH! What a phenomenal book! I have read so many books as part of my personal development but I always find that authors end up glorifying themselves throughout continuously going on and on about their own achievements. Yes you finish the book feeling pumped up to a certain extent and feeling like you too, can be a superstar only to find yourself in the same place a week later.This book is completely different, a no nonsense, down to earth practical piece with fantastic takeaways which anyone can apply so easily to fit in with their lifestyle. It is so methodical in it's approach and so clear (the family name suits him well! :-p).It has a perfect blend of research, anecdotes, real life stories, tools and references. I also love his sense of humour and those little details interjected along the way. I simply did not want the book to end.I urge anyone who loves the book to read his blog which has loads of truly awesome resources. Having implemented some of the tools, I already find that they have had a tremendous impact.He is for me the Dale Carnegie of the modern era with added humour. Cannot recommend this book enough.  I bought it on Kindle and had to buy the paperback version too to have it on my shelf!

  James Clear has a great writing style which captures you and makes it easy to grasp his teaching. I have been reading his blog for years and got tremendous value from his actionable points. Keep up the good work James! Atomic Habits will be life changing for many. A few of my favourite concepts : 4 Burners theory, the bus station (life choices), and focusing on a system as opposed to goals.

  This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to build good habits and break bad ones (And who doesn't ?).Unlike most books I'd read on the subject, ""Atomic Habits"" is neither an autobiography nor a purely theoretical piece of writing. In fact, it is a real hands-on book and the strategies it contains can be applied immediately.The major concept of the book is to focus on small but consistent improvement. The author argues that ""just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results"". According to James Clear, there are four stages that are crucial when it comes to creating good habits (and breaking bad ones):1. Cue -Make it obvious (invisible)2. Craving - Make it attractive (unattractive)3. Response - Make it easy (difficult)4. Reward - Make it satisfying (unsatisfying)In my opinion ""Atomic Habits"" is a treasure for anyone seriously interested in personal development and self-improvement.

  I have enjoyed reading the weekly newsletter James sends out so knew the book would be good, I just didn’t know how good. It is so practical and explains ideas in a way that I could connect with. There are so many great strategies to address the barriers to maintaining habits. ‘Never miss twice’ has become my profile picture and such a great way to deal with the occasional relapse to laziness or when life takes over. Thanks James for sharing these ideas in such a useable format and for staying on task so the rest of us can achieve our full potential too.

  James Clear is the best.  His writing is clear, sorry, no joke intended there - all straightforward and beautifully expressed.  His character and integrity come through honestly.  The ideas are all explained and illustrated with examples, and you will find them practical and helpful.  I'd recommend getting on to his email list, as his regular free communications are rather better than many other people pushing life-improvement concepts.  (If you don't agree with me you can always unsubscribe!)  The book is well worth the value, in my opinion.

  This isn't the first time I've read a book Frankensteined together from a blogger's blog. And that the original blog posts were Frankensteined together with info gleaned from books by other people. Like BJ Fogg, founder of the Behaviour Design Lab at Stanford (the Tiny Habits guy). Don't get me wrong, it's good to have all these behaviour tips from lots of different experts in one place. Let's face facts, it saves you having to read all the books James Clear has read on the subject. And I'll undoubtedly re-read it and extract notes next time. But from my initial read, I just felt there was something not quite right about it. It didn't quite flow. Like it wasn't put together in the right order, know what I mean? I dunno, maybe it was just my imagination and I'm being a meanie. See what you think...

  I did warn you I was going to be cheesy: Yep, this book has changed my life.In fact, following James Clear's emails for the past few years has had a hand in changing my life for the better, too.Here's an example: I used to struggle to get up early. I was really, really, REALLY awful at it... yet I do my best work when I get up early. (To me, early is 6.30 am.) I made one simple change based on this book, and now I get up at 6.30 every day. I know, I know, it's a tiny thing – but it's a big deal to me.And that's not the only way my life has changed for the better.This book is on my ""must read every year"" list, not just because it's full of actionable, practical, non-judgemental advice and info, but because it's an enjoyable read. I teach business owners how to write books, and this is one of the best I've read. There's no filler. No boring preaching. Just great stories and clear actions to take.If you're struggling to build and maintain good habits, and change bad habits, this is the book for you.

  Atomic Habits review“Get 1% better every day”.I am slightly biased in writing this review because prior to reading the book I already possessed a near religious belief in habits and how they impact our lives. Having read previous habit books like Charles Duhigg Power of Habits and Marshall Goldsmith “triggers”, I felt I was at least relatively intermediate on my knowledge of the topic.Why did I read the book then? Because learning (or reinforcing learning) about habits is one of the most powerful ways for you to improve in the game of life. Your habits shape your destiny is one of my core beliefs so I am always happy to try to get a new “edge” or ways to improve them. I alsoexpected to find new gems that would help reinforce the message of why habits are so powerful and I was not disappointed.But enough of my own habits and life, the question is whether you should read this book? The resounding answer is YES.Honestly, who doesn’t want to get better at something? Or who doesn't want to stop doing something?James Clear is a fantastic writer who I have followed his informative articles on a variety of topics for nearly a year. A lot of what is in the book is material he has written about on his website as other reviewers have stated but he puts it together in a very neat format for the book so even his regular readers should get something out of this. I actually took so many notes/highlights from the Kindle edition that I almost reached the publisher limit of 10% - a sign that I believe highly in what I am reading and want to reflect upon it for years to come.The opening pages of the book lay down a quote I will now repeat forever “if you can get 1% better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty- seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero.” The beginning lays out why habits are so powerful and how habits shape who we are as people before getting into the HOW of starting to build better habits.The core of the book is based on the author’s “4 Laws” of habit change - Make it obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying”. By following the laws of habit creation we improve our chances of success in creating new habits.Without droning on too long, I must highly recommend this book. Even if you have no idea about what a habit is or if you are already advanced in the practising of habit change then this book will still teach you so much. If not just a refresher on the topic to keep you motivated. Seriously, anyone of any age could benefit from this book. It gives you the tools to start thinking more clearly about your life and improving it. I would recommend it to anyone over the other habit books I have read (see above) as it is relatively short and provides the “how to” parts on a silver platter.I will end my post on a few excellent quotes of the book towards the end (Ch.19 ”How to Stay Motivated” as this is the golden question for once you finish the book. A coach was asked by Clear what is the difference between the best athletes and everyone else? The coach said: ‘the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”“Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade.It is a fantastic book but the key thing will be can you then translate that into action? The book gives you the best leg up you can get - it’s then up to you to turn knowledge into action and go and get 1% better every darn day.

  The book is fascinating. Great concepts and easy to read. It gets one star because the quality of the printing is absolute crap. I can barely read some of the letters. Random House is a big publishing name. They've obviously skimped by going to the cheapest possible printing press in the world. There's even a page that has a hand-written number printed on it!

  I'm a little snobby about self help books -  like many things, there's a handful of excellent ones, and a lot of rubbish. This falls into the former category. I've read and enjoyed a few of the author's articles and wondered if there was enough to justify a book... there is. It's much easier to apply than Covey's 7 habits of highly effective people (one of 3 personal development books I like including this one) and the tone is informed but humble. More importantly, my resistant butt is exercising again, reading more and watching less mindless tv so that's proof enough for me. Will happily recommend.

  Atomic Habits has some mildly entertaining anecdotes to pad out content that could probably fit one chapter. Nothing wrong with the advice for encouraging better behaviour.Where it failed for me is the lack of help overcoming obstacles. ""Make it easy to do"" is the message. Fine if you have a busy job, children, an illness or a long commute. I once saw this summarised as ""James Bond doesn't do housework.""

  On reflection, I am not sure that I added a great deal to my stock of knowledge about human habits from reading this book. But I did find the presentation of the material here very clear and very persuasive - and it might actually lead to changes in my life  - where previous reading about habits has simply added to my stock of knowledge.Particularly interesting, and particularly easy to implement are the thoughts that: it's helpful to take stock of habits and think what you want to do about them (after all you've acquired them rather randomly through life), and that it's fairly easy to do something about them - form intentions that are linked to 'cues' or times and places (rather than just vague intentions) and reflect on what it's very easy to do to get a habit going - read one page of a book at bedtime for example, not a chapter, and find habits that themselves bring rewards (find a nice flavour of toothpaste for example)...and it's also good on bad habits (mostly: avoid cues, like returning Vietnam vets avoided Vietnam cues - or you might keep alcohol or high sugar drinks out of the house)...There's a bit of helpful overall encouragement too - small changes to habits can add up to big changes in your life...And some further material that while interesting (for example a comparison of the physiques of swimmers and middle distance runners) seems a little set apart from the main themes of the book...Sometimes you might question the analysis (is over-eating really because we are suckers for high fat high sugar foods due to our genes, or is it that 'we need protein and will eat till we get it' as for example in the book Eat Like The Animals - which is an interesting variant on this theme)....Overall, though, strongly recommended.

  Great practical book: deserves 5/5 for a useful recap of cue - craving - response - reward model of behaviour.Again 5/5 for highly useful practical suggestions on how to get some new helpful habits going, and how to try and extinguish some of the not-so-attractive ones.This is lightweight reading, however. It is a noble relative to the awfully dumbed-down Duhigg on habits, but belongs to the same family. If you find word count filler frustrating, brace yourself. If you get a warm and comfortable feeling from academic literature, hold your nose and read Atomic Habits really fast. But do read it.

  This book just might be the most important book you ever read.We all know what we need to do to be successful but we don't do it. Why? We have the wrong habits. We surf the net when we know we should be starting the company we know we can. We eat candy when we know we should be eating something healthily... and so on. By why do we do these things we know are wrong? And why don't we do the things we know are right? Because we have the wrong habits. I used to think that will power was something you either had innately or you didn't. The author clearly explains that this is not true. Will power is more about your environment than anything innate. He also explains how to change your environment to get rid of bad habits and instil new, good ones. I read this book a week ago and it has already changed my life. Read it, summarise it and re-read the summary. Treat it like a book you have to master for university exams. It's brilliant and if you apply the rules, you have every chance of realising your potential.

  Like many of his contemporaries, James Clear is here re-framing ideas that have always been with us, a combination of ancient philosophy and modern science.  Commonly called 'self-help', another collective term of these works may be the genre of 'Intentionality.'  Intentional living, being purposeful, and having a system to embed that purpose, to achieve a dynamic momentum that will propel you forward.Here the system is about noticing the triggers in our lives for good and bad behaviours, and being intentional about them.  Building on them.  So you build motivators onto and generate the triggers that are good for you and improve you.  You make the bad triggers as intentionally as unpleasant as possible.  The titular 'Atomic Habits' are the small things that on their own are negligible, but cumulatively, to borrow a key phrase from this book, they stack up, and tip the scales, one way or another.  James Clear here gives us a system to help us tip the scales in our favour.Like many of this genre chapters are introduced with various hard won paths to success of those who have excelled at their craft, be that sports, business, science, arts.  We then dig into the moral of their story and a new feature of the habits system is explored.  Each chapter ends with a bullet point summing up.The book's soul is with behavioural science.  It is a very 'bio-mechanical' view of life and endeavour that lacks mystery and real profundity.  It's all rather clinical.Still, it's like watching a Ted talk where the person's breathless delivery at least makes you listen.  And we can all do with a bit of extra intentionality.

  Honestly I have struggled to get through this book. Seems like the author really had to go out of his way to get the word count up to create hundreds of pages of words which could have really just have been a short story. Pretty much all of the stuff in this book is common sense, which to be fair to the Author not a lot of people are born with so if you are looking for some sort of revelation within the pages I am afraid you will be sorely disappointed. For those who have absolutely no idea of how to help yourself and create positive rather habits and remove negative ones may find some use in this book, other reviews would suggest that I am in the minority here so if you do find something then more power to you but for me, None of this was new news and could have been said in much fewer words, much like this review...

  In essence, this book explains that building good habits which are consistently applied in life are the key to long term success. Lots of small steps in the right direction work best - hence the use of the word ""atomic"" in the title. This compares favourably to setting ambitious goals and single mindedly working towards those in giant leaps which aren't sustained or sustainable if/once the goal has been reached. I suppose it's the difference between doing well in your studies because you do a little bit of work every day, research every essay thoroughly and do all the homework (these would all be considered atomic habits) and passing a course because you revise in the last week and ace the exam (or not). Ultimately, we all know that those who work hard consistently do better in the end than those who rely on talent, luck and erratic spurts of effort. It's an okay book which I read on the recommendation of a teacher, however, I personally prefer the book on Kaizen - One Small Step to Change Your Life. I think because I've grown increasingly chilled by the American ""self help"" style of book which makes for a very slow read and is packed with anecdotes to illustrate each and every point the author makes. However, I was completely impressed with the author's personal story which he uses to illustrate how he achieved incredible results in his life by structuring his time around excellent habits.

I can say I've been pleasantly surprised.I'll be revisiting and rereading the book from time to time because there's so much in there to absorb and implement. Some may find it overwhelming, particularly if they're feeling they need to instil many habits with a limited amount of time, as the book is detailed and isn't about quick fixes. A delve into the fascinating psychological underpinnings of our habits combined with an actionable guide implementing habits you would like to do more of and lessening the habits you would like to stay away from. It isn't a one size fits all solution, so taking the time to understand why things that are working work well, and the things that don't stick with us is important. The author has really put in the effort to share his expertise on habits in a way that is digestible and informative. Given the complexity of human beings, it's no wonder it takes a whole book just to get into habit formation. The book stays illuminating til the end.Well worth the purchase, will be a staple in my library whose many wise ideas I'll be sharing with others.

  As I write this, Atomic Habits has spent 85 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list in the category ‘Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous’. This is extraordinary, and out of curiosity I decided to try it.James Clear is not a scientist, though he’s a self-declared expert on habits, and my first impression of the book as I read about a childhood accident he had, his experience as a baseball player and businessman, was not a good one. But the book grew on me.He writes well, he cites good sources (all footnoted), he sums up his main points at the end of every (very short) chapter, and the book makes sense.The basic point – made by him and others who write about this field – seems to be to make small changes, be consistent, and over time you’ll get results.If you’re struggling with the examples he frequently cites — you want to lose weight, read more books, do better in your profession, etc. — this book is not a bad place to start.

  I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it as I suspected either: 1) a repetitive farrago of cheesy platitudes, or: 2) ‘inspiring’ success stories of people naturally endowed with tremendous willpower, steely resolve, and steadfast belief in one’s own worth. On the contrary, this approach is at the same time practical, grounded in science, and eminently ‘human’. With ‘human’ I mean based on a solid, deeply emphatic understanding of the way ordinary people think, act, and make mistakes, not on ideal, out-of-reach models.Here’s the nub of it: change doesn’t necessary start with a powerful resolution or a clean cut, it may well be the incremental effect of minuscule (hence the title) adjustments in the way we go about with our daily lives. Improvement is the outcome of a gradual and methodical process of removing what doesn’t work and replacing it with more effective habits. Small, sustained changes can have big future impacts.Mind you. There’s nothing 100% original in the book, but the way the material is presented is good: eminently readable; practical, and nicely organised in short chapters. Some methods are surprisingly clever, can be implemented in no time, and look effective. Highly recommended.

  I particularly appreciated the practical and analytical approach of this book i.e. analyse your habits first before applying the science of 'Atomic Habits'. The principles of developing and maintaining good habits are outlined and explained but also interesting anecdotes and suggestions are weaved into each chapter which keeps it interesting. Reading just 1-2 chapters a day gave me chance to reflect on how to apply each set of principles to myself.One example - as a result of reading this book, every night before bed I leave my tablets for the morning on my sit-up machine which reminds me to do a few sets of crunches before I take them the next day. It works because it's tailored to my own routine and aligned with my identity. I wouldn't have ever done that had I not read this book.

I've long been an advocate of building new muscles through both small steps and creating conducive environments both personally as well as in my coaching with clients and organisations.

  I can't find fault with this book. It's quite simply the best and most informative book on habits and how to change them.There's so much insight into human psychology and how it manifests in our daily habits. However, James Clear goes further by showing how the challenges of modern life complicates our efforts to make meaningful changes and how to overcome them. We are bombarded with cues from our environment that the primitive brain is naturally drawn towards and this explains a lot of our habit formation.Atomic Habits is packed with strategies to start changing habits today.

  having heard many wonderful things about this book, I decided to pick it up and give it a read.I can honestly say that I was not disappointed.  This book has a range of practical advice alongside examples of activities we can do to create better habits, and therefore better lives, for ourselves. None of the recommended activites come across as difficult or particularly challenging and can easily be actioned on a day to day basis.For example, he mentions Habit Stacking 'After [CURRENT HABIT] I will [HABIT I NEED]'. This can be actioned into 'After [BRUSHING MY TEETH] I will [DO 15 SQUATS]'. By combining what you already do with something you want to introduce into your life, you are much more likely to do it.

  The reason that I picked the book is because of Ali Abdaal (A famous Youtuber)’s video who mentioned: “the score takes care of itself.” (from Bill Walsh). This is what I want exactly. People always tell me set an annual target, break it down to daily, it will be easier for me to achieve it. In fact, it turns out stress and disappointment frequently. I don’t understand why everyone’s method doesn’t work for me; I have been doubting myself until this book releases me. I am not the one who can keep looking the scores and achieve it at the end. In fact, I am the one who sets the target and keep doing it under stress-free condition. Another useful thing is filling out the sentence of I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

I'm so sorry, the sample was promising and I really wanted to like the book but it was endless drudgery to get to what could have been some very salient and helpful points that I'd ultimately lost interest in. I even moved from my Kindle Oasis to my phone to implement Word Runner in an effort to end the pain and it still wasn't quick enough on the fastest speed. I really did give it my best shot and dragged myself to 42% of the book but in the end I flicked through until I got to the Chapter Summaries which said enough and so I finished off what I'd started in a relatively painless yet dreary way. Sorry :(

  I don't think I've benefitted from a book so quickly.From chapter 1, and I've found things in this book that have resonated with me and that I've been able to put to use right away. Most books like this contain a lot of waffle and don't get to the how-to part until later on in the book. Atomic Habits is not that book that book.My suggestion is to have a notepad handy and write down the guide the author lays forth (things like the habit stacking or making bad habits invisible). There is a step to step guide in this book that warrants writing down.One of my favourite books!

  This book has given me a more positive outlook on life and I now strive to improve something about my life, no matter how small (or atomic), each day. It's a really insightful and inspiring read and makes you realise that things we often perceive as difficult or impossible are achievable with small incremental improvements each day. It's also interesting to read about the psychology behind productivity and little things you can do improve such as reorganising your environment. I made some changes immediately to my working environment and I can say my productivity has increased ten fold. Well worth a read.

  I literally cannot say enough great things about this author and this book. I was recommended by someone on Instagram and thought I’d give it a try and after the first chapter I was delighted I had. It’s so informative about the way we end up choosing bad habits over good and how to turn this round. The book is really straight forward to read and has lots of examples of the authors life and how he changed his own habits around just by making tiny 1% changes each day and after doing this for years the results were amazing. A must read for anyone looking to lose weight, get fit and healthy, change career paths or just make a positive change in their life. 5⭐️

  Honestly, I'm grown sick of the number of self-help books that I've downloaded, only to find that the key message can be written in a couple of lines, and the rest of the book is taken up with padding out the point.Atomic Habits doesn't do that. It doesn't make grandiose visionary statements, or adopt the ""just do it"" warrior philosophy. Instead it draws on evidence and practices designed to improve human performance. And instead of focusing on how to be better by pretending to be someone else, it shows you how to be better by paying attention to the small daily practices that will make you better, by consistently doing them.The greatest thing about Atomic Habits is that it accepts humans are weak. Motivation and will are transitory, says Clear. And so, he sets out an approach which allows us to work with who we are, rather than who we wish we were.This book is a series of simple messages, supporting a simple thesis: to make it easy for you to consistently repeat behaviours what will make you a better person.

  The opening chapters really inspired me to make changes to my habit processes, which I am in fact implementing.  The latter half of the book seemed to drift off into weird stories about cats!

  This book was recommended to me by my coach and I have to say that I approached it with a fair degree of scepticism. I have read some books in this category and the quality has varied. I was really taken with the power of the simple atomic metaphor - smallest molecules yet we have the atom bomb! The book is clearly structured, well written in bite-size chunks - and if you apply the habit stacking approach in particular, my experience tells me that you will see good results. The linkage of habits to your core identity is another simple yet really powerful anchor to the book. Definitely worth reading.

  The kind of writing that makes it feel like the book he wanted to write couldn't have been written much better, even with a large amount of further effort. Very concise, clear, sequential, useful writing that is easy to understand and apply without being boring or taking too long to read. Feels like a structured essay that was brutally pared down to the most important parts.  Chapters are short explanations/summaries of various concepts and strategies (usually focused on one per chapter along with a story or real life example) that are simplified and then fitted to a lightweight, easy to remember framework, allowing for easy recall and individual contextual extrapolation in your real life. As always, different books are better or worse fits for different people at different points in their lives that have different tastes and usage cases. This book has its own style, and if you think it might be a good fit for what you need, you should consider it. I found it fun to read, interesting and useful.

  This book is leaps and bounds ahead of what I ever thought it would be. Just one chapter in and I ascertained just how insightful, captivating and most importantly practical of a read it would prove to be. James Clear has a way with words that does not rely on heavy linguistic prowess, no. He makes it very much clear (no pun intended) early on that the goal of his book is to offer as streamlined of a guide to building healthy habits as possible, no shortcuts, no beating around the book with fancy vocabulary. And it does just that, in the most brilliant and impactful ways imaginable. Do yourself and the world around you a favour and buy this book :)

He's clearly a student of human nature and uses a wealth of examples that can give you enough to get started with immediately.The opening story of an injury from baseball may be traumatising for some squeamish readers, but it shows the amazing courage that James had as a very young man.

  This book shows how creating small habits can lead to big improvements in your life.Having read other books relating to habits before, I find this one to be the most useful for forming new habits, and eliminiting bad habits.The main difference is that the author has created a system that is not focused on the goal or outcome, but squarely on changing how you react to cues or by simply changing your enviroment to make it easier to avoid a bad habit, and form a new habit.

  I need to make changes to my life and was recommended this book. I mixed between reading on Kindle and listening on Audible on my morning walks. I endeavoured to screenshot the chapter summaries to use as reference later.I really enjoyed it, the chapter length, the tone, the mix of scientific evidence as well as James' own findings. I can see ways that I will be able to use the things I've learned going forward but also felt a bit like I needed something more for the specific areas of my life I need help with. However, I see this as more an issue of relativity to my own life which must be hard to hit every nail on its head as an author when humans are so different and diverse, rather than an overarching issue with the work.Would recommend

  I've read many self improvement books, and with all honesty none have gotten to the point and showed you what to do as well as James Clear has done in this book. Moreover the thing I love the most about implementing the strategies he gives, is that they're really simple and easy to start.When trying to start something new we usually bite too much than we can chew. For example if you want to become fit and aim to go to the gym, you're first few sessions may be really intense but then soon after you'll leave the whole habit. We're trying to improve a habit that we haven't even built. And so instead it is better to start with something as dead simple as just staying at the gym for five minutes, and then steadily increasing it. Long term rather than short term.Moreover, once you finish this book there are several several wonderful articles on his website; Jamesclear.comAll in all, you can't go wrong with this my friend.

  Although a large percentage of the 2300 plus books I have read since January 2000 are audio, mostly from Audible, I feel this is a case where you need a print edition.  With non-fiction books I like to mark the margin in pencil to identify key points, then create my own index, and that is certainly the case here.  Although James provides a chapter summary, which is most useful, the items that have relevance for you are worth noting.  James kindly sent me chapter 1, as he no doubt did to tens of thousands on his mailing list.  I found this most interesting and prompted me to buy two copies (one to loan to friends) in due course.  On reflection it occurred to me that there are 1440 minutes in the day, 1% being 14.4 minutes.  Round that up to 15 minutes – a quarter of an hour.  All of us can devote 1% a day to a desired project, and over time that adds up.  I decided that apart from whatever else I was doing in the writing field, preparing my novel THE PRICE TO PAY and a collection of 25 short stories – THE FORK IN THE ROAD – to go on Kindle, etc. I would devote 1% a day to writing a new short story.  Consequently, since the end of October 2018 I have written 8 stories with a word count of a bit over 38,000 words.  I do acknowledge that when the creative process is upon me and I am nearing the end I might get up at 4:30 am and write for a couple of hours, but it has been an excellent discipline.  I believe that anyone who wants to improve their productivity, refine the process by which they achieve this and become more efficient in achieving your goals, ATOMIC HABITS is a book to read, then read again and again.

  This book makes you understand how good and bad habits develop while giving a few good tips on how to prevent bad habits from repeating as well as build good ones. Thanks to this understanding, it's easier to gain awareness about our own behaviour and, as a consequence, turns out to be very helpful to take action and move towards the direction we are looking for. I haven't given 5 stars just for a personal reason.

  This book is life changing. I have followed James Clear's newsletters for a number of years and was so excited to hear that he  was writing a book. Atomic Habits does not disappoint. I have actually listened to the audio version and bought and studied the written version. Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy and Satisfying are etched in my brain when I am struggling with any of my current habits that have gone pear shaped  or I am thinking of making changes in my life. James covers it all. I have been a  health care practitioner for almost three decades and a couple of years ago I had a realisation that understanding habit formation is the secret to health and wellbeing when I was struggling myself. We all know what to to do but how do we do it and how do we do it consistently; Atomic Habits is the answer. This book is a must read if you want to take responsibility for your health, wellbeing and your life. Thank you, James.

  This was a great read with lots of useful concepts. What separated this book from other books that deal with productivity or similar concepts is that this book started from the basics: how to get motivated in the first instance. Thereafter should clearly the development of effective habits and proves the effect of their compound gains. This is a book which is well worth re-reading.

  The author felt like a great mentor talking in your ears throughout the book. Guiding you with effective techniques that anyone could quite easily apply in his/her life no matter the stage or age one stands at. I personally look forward to implementing several strategies laid out. Biggest takes for me were: every 1% eventually compounds and constant reflection is needed to master any skill or field in life!Immense gratitude for the immaculate articulation.

  I thought I already knew quite a bit about how to change habits. But this book taught me a lot.--> Science-based with highly actionable steps.In many different ways, I can be an ""all or nothing"" kind of person, like: not doing any sports for 6 months and then starting a new exercise program with 1 h of exercise each day. That ""strategy"" helped me with a lot of things, not with others. Now I understand why and how to tackle that more successfully.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in living a full and rich life without the constant frustration of trying to implement new things and failing 3 days in because it is so hard to ""keep up the motivation"" when life gets in the way. It's not the motivation. There is so much more to it. This applies to things such as diet, exercise, thought-patterns, music, language, any skill acquisition etc.This book easily makes the top 10 of my favorite books ever across all categories.

  I'm reluctant to call this a 'self-help' book, because that lump it into the 95% of 'self-help' that contain inspiring words & messages that make you feel great for a couple hours, but after 2 weeks you have forgotten. This book is different because it doesn't pretend to be a motivational book, which is very refreshing.I have highlighted so many fascinating insights and tips from the pages within this book.I think many people have the idea that they need more 'motivation' or 'willpower' to improve themselves, but in reality that is just not a strategy that works if you want to improve your daily habits.Thanks James Clear, i'm a fan

  A book like this could easily become laboured and overly self help focussed. This is actually more about performance improvement and increasing self discipline. The book did not preach though it made it clear that taking up some of the thinking would be beneficial to a person’s life. Another key factor is the lack of density, the book does not waffle instead it is direct and focussed.

  I’ve read many self improvement books but this is the only one that has absolutely made a difference and boy did I need it.The author writes incredibly well and this book is very logical and relatable.  He demonstrates his ideas as well with graphs and everything makes so much SENSE.  The very small incremental improvements we can make in our lives not only add up Over time and done so gradually it takes no effort or feelings of deprivation (when losing a bad habit) but COMPOUND, i.e. we earn interest on our interest.  I have never been good at goal setting and I severely lack motivation.... or so I thought until I read this book.Now, I am eating really healthily, exercising (something that used to be an effort), I have switched my bottle of wine a night habit to herbal tea and I look and feel like a different person.

  If you’re looking for a book about anecdotes and banalities... this is it.It was boring and absolutely useless. I guess that it’s a great motivational book to read if you : don’t clean, don’t exercice, smoke a pack of cigarettes a day... However if you’re a person with decent habits and motivation this will already state what you already know.Quite confusing also because a few of these « tips » seem to contradict themselves throughout the book, but since I was dozing off half of the time, maybe I missread a few chapters.

  I can't say enough good things about this book and how it's helped me get more done, and have a healthier life. The logic of his steps just make sense. Keep at it and the next thing you know, you're finally feeling productive and overall there is improvement on many levels. My only worry, and the reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the beginning of the book where the author goes on and on about his accomplishments. It smacked of incredible insecurity and unwarranted over the top bravado. I wish he'd had the confidence to just introduce his beliefs and system and allow the process to speak for itself, otherwise I think some people will just stop before they even get to what matters in the book. I'd say ignore the first 1/4, and read the really good ideas that, if you stick to them, even haphazardly in the beginning, eventually before you know it, it all falls into place. You'll be glad you read this book and followed what this man passionately believes in. Good luck :-).

  I usually allow Amazon's reviews to influence my purchases and they usually are spot on.  Not this time.  I was excited to read this based on all the reviews, but I wasn't impressed.  Just my opinion, but this a collection of common sense.  I must have said ""really, people don't do/know this already???"" 100 times.  The anecdotes seemed lazy and I just thought it was super boring.  I'm sure it could be useful for a lazy teenager but yeah, a whole lot of common sense.

  I have been receiving James Clear's newsletter for several months so when the book got out I ordered the kindle version immediately. But while the newsletter is occasionally interesting, the book is rather empty. There's nothing new, it's just a rehash of other books on the subject. There is no new perspective, no new insights. And there's nothing atomic about it. I am really disappointed, and I could not believe that the book became an instant best seller. If you have never read anything about habit forming, you will benefit from this book. But if you have, I don't see what you can get from Atomic Habits. I am also becoming tired of all the personal success stories from book authors because they can't be applied to the layman. I found there was nothing to learn from James' baseball days, as I never was an athlete and never excelled in sport. Feels like the average reader can't do this. I have bought the audible and Kindle version and will return one of them, keeping the other just to be fair to the author

  Love this book so far but I started to notice the terrible printing quality as soon as I started reading it. There were pages that the text was completely pushed to the side. I wasn’t happy about it but didn’t care because I could still read the words. Until I got to page 53. I turned the page to see that it jumped to page 70. There was a whole chunk of the chapter missing and the section that replaces it is repeated later on (where it’s supposed to be). Very disappointed in the quality of this book.

  Non so dire se questo libro mi sia servito al 100% però é sicuramente una lettura interessante.Clear struttura ogni singolo capitolo con definizioni, spiegazioni ed esempi pratici di persone famose (per lo più sportivi) che si sono costruiti una vita, una carriera, partendo da piccole abitudini. Dopodiché consiglia come applicarli nella propria vita.L’autore ovviamente da una base, il resto poi spetta a noi.Sicuramente si percepisce la passione, la ricerca e il duro lavoro che ci sono dietro questo libro.

  Ich habe einige Bücher zu dem Thema Gewohnheiten abzulegen oder aufzubauen gelsen aber dieses Buch sticht von allen so dermaßen heraus.  James Clear ist gerade zu Gott was das Thema angeht und VOR ALLEM: das Buch ist extrem praktikabel angelegt und verliert sich nicht allzusehr wie andere Bücher das tun ohne wirklich hilfreich zu sein oder Anleitungen zu geben in endlosen Geschichten und Anekdoten. Geschichten dienen hier allein dazu um die anzuwendenden Punkte unzusetzen. Ich bin dank dem Buch viel effiktiver und strukturierter geworden. Ich gehe mittlerweile 4 mal die Woche zum Sport was mir vorher als unmöglich erschien und viel zu radikal. Das ist nur EIN Beispiel welchen Einfluss das Buch auf mich hatte. Absolut empfehlenswert!

  Da premettere che molte delle cose scritte già le sapevo, grazie ai consigli della mia bellissima mamma. Nella mia opinione, il libro è molto ben impostato, strutturato in modo semplice, spiega tutte le fasi di pensiero che ci sono tra il desiderio e la reale volontà di un cambiamento, qualunque questo sia.

  Although this is not a scientific book per se, it is one of the most thoroughly researched books about behavior and habit formation I have read to date. A mist read for anyone seeking a step-by-step process to implement good habits in their lives and for making bad habits less and less impactful until they are replaced for good ones (as any good reader in the science of habits know, you can't really erase an habit but only substitute it for a good one with the same Cue).

  International Bestseller, Atomic Habits: an easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones by James Clear is filled with the best science on personal growth and success. Also on the cover, it says, “Tiny changes, remarkable results.”Mr. Clear’s premise is that only making a 1 percent improvement each day compounds to make remarkable results over time.In each chapter, Clear cites scientific research that points out these principles and how to break one’s goals down into micro-goals and tasks that are manageable into 2-minute time frames and stacked with one’s current habits in order to cement the new practice with something that’s already done habitually subconsciously.Overall, I found this book very helpful in how to take baby steps to transform my life – in any and all areas of my life. I consider it a ‘keeper,’ that I will refer to over and over as I implement these suggestions.I highly recommend this book for anyone who’s a student of personal growth or business success.

  I found the four laws easy to understand and apply. Two things especially useful were the concepts about 'the plateau of latent potential', and 'the three layers of behavior change'.

  First of all: don't buy this version of the book. Incredible poor quality, torn pages, poor formatting, suddenly different fonts appear, etc.Content-wise: I kept reading many recommendations about this book and eventually bought it. Therefore, I probably held high expecations of it which were increased when James Clear claims that he would extend findings of luminaries such as B.F. Skinner. Long story short: he does not.From start to end the book remains very superficial. I am sure there are many good take aways for readers who have no prior (or scientific) knowledge about this topic. Others I recommend to watch a Youtube-Video of the author. That's all you need - the rest of the book are just stories.A better book for this type of content is ""Switch"" by the Heath brothers.Readers of this book should also be very cautious from a psychological perspective. Creating habits can be very helpful but if you overdue it (like it is frequently suggested in this book) you might be prone to a life characterized by compulsiveness and unease.

  This book clearly and concisely lays out how to build and sustain habits in your life. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to change their routines.I have enjoy James' website for years. The writing style is clear and direct. The book is broken into bite sized chapters which distill the core ideas from the book. I know I am going to be using the chapter summaries for years to come whenever I need a refresher.The book is quite dense. I intentionally tried to read it more slowly to let the ideas sink in.

  Atomic Habits ist das Buch, auf das ich gewartet habe, ohne davon zu wissen. In einer leicht zugänglichen Sprache wird strukturiert und aufeinander aufbauend erklärt, wie Gewohnheiten unser Leben bestimmen und wie wir sie ganz einfach für uns nutzen können.Ich kann das Buch allen empfehlen, die mit kleineren oder grösseren Dingen ihres alltäglichen Lebens nicht zufrieden sind, die schlechte Gewohnheiten los werden oder gute Gewohnheiten fördern wollen. Die Methode ist einfach anwendbar und erfolgversprechend.Meine Erwartungen waren eigentlich recht gering und auf den ersten Seiten kam mir alles etwas zu amerikanisch vor, amerikanisch im Sinn von: Auch Du kannst super erfolgreich werden und den amerikanischen Traum wahr werden lassen, aber das Buch hat mich echt überzeugt.Wer das Buch nicht lesen will und doch neugierig ist, das Hörbuch tut's auch.

Jedem, der eine einigermaßen ""normale"" Erziehung genossen hat, dürfte wohl klar sein, dass Gewohnheiten einen Einfluss aufs Leben haben.

   I am a business owner from Berlin, Germany. I profited a lot from this book. In this short review, I'd like to highlight just three concepts from the book.First, the author says that habits are the compound interest of self improvement. Many people give up a long time before they can experience the compound effect of their efforts. So when going after a worthwile goal, then what is needed is a lot of patience and perseverence.Second, the author says it's good to have goals but it's so much better to have a system and concentrate on executing the system instead. Because if we do just that, we can be happy every time we execute our plan.Third, identity change is the fastest way to get what we want in life.Instead of saying: ""I want to work out three times a week"" we could be saying: ""I am an athletic person"" or instead of saying ""I want to write a book"" we should be saying to ourselves: ""I am an author"" - because what does an author do? He writes. It's really as easy as that.

  Are you self-motivated but have trouble finishing what you start? So did I, until I read Atomic Habits. The surprisingly simple techniques this book will teach you will make you feel like you can do anything. I was procrastinating about everything, now everything I want in life is cultivating one habit at a time. I made my whole family read this book after I was done with it. It is seriously a game changer. I recommend it to anyone who has dreams or goals but not the consistency and drive to achieve them.

  Das Buch beginnt mit einer kurzen Einführung, und einer Schilderung welche die Beweggründe des Autors näher beleuchtet. Danach kommt er zügig zum Punkt und man wird mit hilfreichen Modellen und Methoden vertraut gemacht, die einem dabei helfen sollen nützliche Gewohnheiten zu etablieren und schlechte Angewohnheiten auszumustern.Das Ganze wird mit Fallbeispielen und Anekdoten ausgeschmückt, und dazwischen gibts jede Menge übersichtliche Tabellen, Zusammenfassungen und konkrete Handlungsanweisungen. Ich persönlich fand die Balance dabei angemessen.Die vorgestellten Konzepte klingen vielversprechend, und laden zum ausprobieren ein. Vor allem die kleinen Kniffe um ins Tun zu kommen sind meines Erachtens besonders hilfreich, und erhöhen die Chance durchzuhalten bis ein angestrebtes Verhalten sich als Teil der Persönlichkeit manifestiert hat.Perfektion ist dabei nicht notwendig. Vielmehr zeigt sich, dass ein durchdachtes System von Gewohnheiten an sich ein mächtiges Werkzeug ist, mit dem Vieles möglich wird, sofern man dranbleibt. Schließlich bringen einen auch kleine Schritte dem Ziel näher.Um bei der Verfolgung von Vorsätzen und guten Absichten nicht die Orientierung bzw. die Motivation zu verlieren, können die Ideen aus diesem Buch sicher einen wertvollen Beitrag leisten. Gerade in den Momenten, wo es wirklich darauf ankommt, kann das den Unterschied ausmachen.

  Ein must read. Das Buch ist sehr gut und auch wenn ich den Inhalt schon kannte, da ich seit Jahren ein E-Mail Abo von James Clear über seine Ideen/Ansichten habe, ist es empfehlenswert es zu kaufen. Der Autor ist kein Übertreiber, auch wenn man es von einem amerikanischen Autor in diesem Bereich fast erwartet. Seine Darstellungen sind moderat in der Sprache, zurückhaltend, aber auch auf einer tiefgründigen Art und Weise  überzeugend. Er begründet seine Thesen mit eigener oder fremder Erfahrung, oft auch mit wissenschaftlichen Studien. Die Ideen sind leicht in den Alltag zu integrieren-das ist eigentlich auch der Sinn des Buches.Mich hat das Buch sehr inspiriert, auch wenn ich bestimmte Teile davon schon als Artikel gelesen habe.

  I chanced upon James Clears’ blog on a random Google search for my “Next Book to Read”. After checking his list of recommendations, I read a few of his posts and I was hooked. The writing was easy to read and understand, his research thorough and reading his posts felt like having a personal life coach cheering you from afar.When I saw Atomic Habits listed on his website, I was very keen to read it. Fast forward 6 months, I finally purchased the kindle version and I am thrilled with it. The book follows his usual style of writing – which is crisp, easy to read and packs a punch. There are actionable insights in the book, that when implemented consistently, can bring about significant changes in our lives. No task seems too big to achieve – ask anyone who has tried building a new habit or deleting an old one from their lives, how difficult it is to keep at it for 21 days or 60 or 90 (depending on which literature you’re reading). But the methods listed in this book can allow you to overcome failure just as easily as they encourage you to successfully implement new habits.The ideas listed in the book are forgiving and generous, quite literally, where some ask you to focus on incremental gains, some don’t reprimand you for missing one day of a new diet / workout schedule, others give you simple, straightforward suggestions to increase your chances of success in implementing new habits.There’s no long story, scientific jargon, unnecessary fillers or flimsy writing to make you NOT want to turn the page. This is definitely worth your money and time.

  The book starts with some basic but crucial info about how small amount of effort each day can make a great difference in the long run. Then it gets more deep in the formation of the habit and how the behaviour can change. It states clearly that Identity has a dramatic influence on formation of the habits. As you read more the book it points out to how one can create a good habit or simply destroy the bad one step by step.  There are list of notes, references and citations at the end of book that verifies what author has stated make sense and this is what makes this book precious. It was such an incredible journey for me to read this book since I have just started to form a new habit in my life and this book definitely helped me to stay motivated and simply know myself better.

I have been able to start a morning routine, stick to existing good habits and break the bad ones (some of them) from the learnings of this book.I also subscribe to James Clear's newsletter which acts as a weekly refresher to some of the concepts from this book and keeps you motivated to continue building good habits.

  Everything the author mentions about this book may sound obvious, but when you start practicing it and making small changes in your life you can achieve many things. I started by being a little bit more organized, then I built a  excercise routine then I started using more my agenda and so on. I don't know where this is going to take me, but I've been feeling better since I started building atomic habits.

  Bei diesem Buch merkt man, wie sehr sich der Autor James Clear mit der Materie auseinandergesetzt hat, über die er dieses Buch geschrieben hat. Und er schafft es, komplexe psychologische bzw. kognitive Vorgänge, die bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung von Habits (also Routinen und Gewohnheiten) eine Rolle spielen, auf eine verständliche Ebene herunterzubrechen und in eine gut zu verfolgende Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung zu übersetzen. Well done!

  Das Buch beschreibt die Psychologie der Gewohnheiten und wie man solche bauen kann. Der Autor postuliert 4 Gesetze und beschreibt ein System,  um gute oder schlechte Gewohnheiten auf- oder abzubauen.Das Buch ist leicht zu lesen, in angenehmen Stil geschrieben, mit ganz vielen Verweisen auf diverse Quellen und Studien.Es gibt nur eine Sache, die mich total nervt - es gibt auch Verweise auf die Webseite des Buchs, die nicht mehr existiert. Damit man die Materialien herunterladen kann, die ursprünglich auf dieser Seite zu finden waren, muss man jetzt den Kaufbeleg an eine bestimmte Email-Addresse schicken.Und wie das so mit Selbsthilfe Bücher ist - man kann sie gerne lesen, aber man muss auch anwenden, was man gelesen hat.

  Most self help books give you sensation of ""wow that was a great read"" but then leave you with no direct actionable steps to implement what they have taught. This book is the complete opposite. It is a complete breakdown of what to do and how. The only way it could be any better is if James would upload a youtube series of him actually breaking down his habits in real time.

  The marketing is solid and the concept of ""Atomic Habits"" is compelling, but everything goes downhill from there.Like so many other productivity books, this is just a collection of one-chapter essays that summarize other people's ideas. The end result is a list of 20+ one-line platitudes like, ""Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior."" It's at once overwhelming, redundant, and incomplete. You read the book and are left thinking, ""OK... so what should I actually do?""I'm sure James is a great person and means well, but that does not mean you should buy his book.

  Over the past few years I have been an avid reader of James Clear’s posts and emails. His blogs and other articles have provided me with a solid structure and framework on habit building thereby driving both achievement and fulfilment in everything I do in life. Whether it is healthy eating, hitting the gym, or keeping my focus in the work environment his advice, tools and approaches have greatly benefited me.I was fortunate enough to get a pre-release copy of Atomic Habits and jumped straight into it. It isn’t a long read, however, it is structured in a way that provides a good overview of why habits are important, tools and techniques on how to establish habits as well as a plethora of real life examples. James also makes reference to an additional set of tools on the Atomic Habits website which you can also leverage (e.g. habit trackers, cheat sheets, guides etc.)The book centres on the both on the four stages of developing a habit and the laws of behaviour change. The latter he delves into in great detail, again with many examples on how to apply within your own life given constraints. The book had a nice pace and balance on theory and application.The biggest thing I have learned (also from his blogs) is the difference between goals and habits. For example, instead of setting a goal, create an identity and establish small habits that align to that identity. For example, don’t say you want to lose weight, but rather identify with being a healthy person that exercises most days and eats well. The habits might be drinking x amount of water a day, 10 push-ups a day, walking 10,000 steps per day etc; and increase the habits once they are firmly established.Given the applicability of this topic, it is a book everyone should read. Unfortunately there are many key areas we don’t get educated on at school. This is one area that is important for life in everything that we do. Highly recommend Atomic Habits!Three key takeaways from the book:1. Habit stacking. Put your clothes out next to your bed before going to sleep so that when you wake up it is the first thing you do or think about. That habit will then drive the habit to go to the gym etc.2. Look to establish identity habits versus reaching for goals or developing finite habits. Habits based on beliefs are much more powerful.3. When it comes to wanting to do something (good or bad) 90% of the dopamine release is driven by the desire versus and 10% on the actual experience.

  Decent but seriously overhyped, this book is a watered-down, distorted shadow of Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg.  If this book is from the Stone Age, then Tiny Habits is from the Space Age.  There are critically important, yet subtle points about the behavior change process that Clear misses in Atomic Habits but that Fogg emphasizes in Tiny Habits.  There's coarse advice in Atomic Habits--such as habit contracts and accountability partners--that are probably more harmful than helpful in many situations.  Remember Fogg's sage advice: ""I change best by feeling good, not by feeling bad.""  Tiny Habits is far more elegant, more concise, and presents a self-contained system that's effective and universal and also explains anything in Clear's book more neatly than Clear presents it himself.  If you have to choose between this book and Tiny Habits, I strongly recommend reading and using Tiny Habits instead.  Even if you've read this book, you should read Tiny Habits to pick up what you've missed out on here and to really calibrate your behavior-change system.  Atomic Habits smacks of being written by a motivational writer with a strong interest in habits who decided to cash in on his large email list with a book deal, while Tiny Habits is written by an actual behavior researcher and educator with a system proven to work on any level and who actually trained tens of thousands of people in his technique before deciding to write a book.  The only way in which Atomic Habits is superior to Tiny Habits is in its discussion of meta-habits (see the section on annual and semiannual reviews).  But even that stuff is freely available online in podcasts and blogs.  I couldn't pick out a single original idea in this book.

  I bought this book because I am a big believer in building habits and predictable routines in one's personal and work life. I read the whole book. I was disappointed.Pros:- Links identity and habits. You are what you do. From that point of view, just going to the gym makes you the type of person who works out, even if you don't do much of a workout.- Introduces the idea that habits bring cumulative benefits like compound interest. While not obviously always the case, it's a powerful idea that definitely applies in areas like meditation or physical training, where the observable changes are minimal at first.Cons:- The book doesn't delve into examples of good habits and the why and how to build them. It stays at the meta / generic level, leaving the reader to think about what habits they may want to build.- The overall principles for building good habits are sound, even if high level and a bit obvious (make the good habits easy, the bad ones hard, etc).- The book is way too long for what it has to convey. Often things repeat or you wonder when the next chapter or thought will start, and when that happens, you lose track of what the earlier one was about -- mainly due to their length.Overall, not recommended.

  I've been reading James Clear's work for a long time.  In fact, I can remember his first two blogs, one for photography and the other was Passive Panda.  Since that time his exploration of habits and how to modify them has easily equaled or surpassed the work of Charles Duhigg.I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve and build good habits or stifle and destroy bad ones.  As I have the audio version,  one of the reasons I give the book 4/5 is due to the speed at which he speaks, which is not bad and I admit to being spoilt by the professional narrators of two other audiobooks in, Deep Work and Rejectionproof. The other reason is the reliance on the work of social scientists, psychologists, etc.  I realize that a number of books in the self-improvement space use scientific studies from the above-mentioned fields but the scandals concerning p-hacking and failure to replicate experiments make me wonder how valid the examples in this book and books like it really are.Having said all of that, I would not have stuck with James all these years if he did not provide information that was useful and more importantly, actionable. I look forward to reading whatever he writes next.

  8/10Atomic Habits is a useful book. It’s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life.I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material.I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesn’t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. It’s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesn’t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an air-tight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit.I’m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best I’ve read because it’s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things he’s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesn’t detract from the book. He expands on most things he’s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you don’t really get from the newsletter.The intro is pretty graphic. It’s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that. Once you get through that it’s all good.

  The most impactful book I've ever read about habits was The Power of Habit....and then Atomic Habits came along. James takes everything I loved about The Power of Habit and expands on it here. The book is chock full of real, practical, and actional advice anyone can take to add more good habits and tweak bad habits over the long term.I was able to listen to a copy and James is a clear narrator who tells an interesting story. He mixes the perfect blend of science and stories to get the point across and make you feel like creating new habits is not some daunting task only for special people but for anyone. I found myself nodding along as I listened and stopped it at least a dozen times to take notes.I got at least 4-5 'a-ha' moments about building habits that shattered the conventional wisdom I'd always thought about before. From realizing that I've been approaching will-power the wrong way and the question that I should ask myself next time I want to lose weight or work out.I've been thinking about Atomic Habits since I finished it and cannot wait to dig into it again. I've been recommending it to everyone.

  I've been a fan of James Clear since I came across the YouTube video in November 2017, ""1% Better Every Day"" (I actually have a recurring reminder set up in my task manager every 6 months to rewatch this video since then---absolutely not kidding!).When I heard on The Productivity Show Podcast that James Clear is coming out with this book on 10/16 I purchased it right on the day it got released. I've read over 40 books this year and I'd consider this book to be one of my personal top 3 most impactful book of 2018.I admit that I am a recovering perfectionist and put a lot of pressure on myself to excel at goals I've set out for myself. After reading this book, instead of focusing on goals I've listed out processes and micro habits it will take to ""become"" the person I want to identify with. I can already feel a huge amount of pressure taken off. Side note: I also love how each chapters start out with a short story relevant to the chapter topic. I look forward to re-reading this book again and reviewing all of my highlighted sections.

  Atomic Habits is a beautiful, fancy, and well marketed book. But it's the wrong book if you're serious about self-improvement. It's surface level over a single method of habit formation and is just flat wrong about some of the principles he claims are key to habit formation. For example, using your identity as the base to build your habits on is dangerous. To understand why, I'd suggest the ""Awareness"" book below. Therefore, if you really want to change read these books instead: - The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal - Awareness by Anthony de Mell

  Wow, What a great book!First I love that the author read the audio version help self. I always think you get more hearing it straight from the author and he has a great voice for it.Second, I really appreciate how practical the whole this is. It’s the perfect mix of how-to advice with scientific research and memorable stories.I’m already seeing results from his “Four simple steps to building better habits.” I can see why some habits I’ve tried to create in the past have failed and why some have succeeded. I also really like the bonus downloads he talks about in the book. The Cheat Sheet has been especially helpful.Third, I love that it’s appropriate and engaging for all ages. I’ve listened to a lot of it with my 11 year old and he’s already experimenting with creating new habits to help him focus on his homework. Of course, it’s because he wants to finish early and move on to video games! But I see how appealing of a reward that is for him, so it’s not all bad.

  Everyone has habits that need changing - things you need to stop doing (smoking, procrastinating) and things you need to start doing more of (exercising, writing). This is a useful guide to the tricks you can use to help you develop good habits and rid yourself of bad ones. For example: Habit needs to become part of your identity (not ""I have to go the the gym"", but ""I am a healthy person""). Make good habits easy to do and bad ones inconvenient (put fruit on your kitchen counter, but hide the cookies). Four points are key: Cue-craving-response-reward.All useful stuff - and worth reminding yourself of now and again. But there is nothing terribly new in this book. I preferred Charles Duhigg's earlier ""The Power of Habit"". This book is worth a quick read, and some of the examples are fun. Certainly, if you follow some of the hints, you will acquire better habits. But not worth five stars.

  I have subscribed to the author's email newsletters for years as I find them both motivating and helpful. His book is similar but is not a rehashed compilation of his emails-- he has actually done a decent amount of research. His biography is also very revealing, having overcome physical hurdles to achieve athletic goals as well as adopting a mindset in college that was different from his peers and allowed him to succeed in the classroom. Clear definitely has some mix of nature and nurture that makes him both intellectually curious and tenacious.To achieve a goal, focus on the habit(s) that help you achieve that goal instead of being fixated on the goal itself. Make performing those habits as easy and natural as possible.""Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?""""Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.This is the secret to self-control.""One challenge I took away from this book is to get into the practice of ""habit stacking,"" setting habits to be performed one after the other:""I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].The habit stacking formula is: 'After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].'""For example, I have a vague goal of doing more pull-ups. I hung a chin-up bar on a door that I walk past frequently. I have a rule: Every time I walk by the door I do one more pull-up than I did before. A good habit-stacking routine might be to think about one thing I'm thankful for after every pull-up routine. Or to also do one more push-up than I did before. Or, since I have a stack of thank you notes I need to write, I write a thank-you note after every pull-up set.""Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.""""Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.""Once I start doing pull-ups, I become a guy who exercises-- who does pull-ups. Pull-ups are a challenge for many people, so I can start to develop an identity that I do challenging things.The author also talks about the importance of making such habits pleasurable. Maybe I have a reward that if I do 15 pull-ups in a day, I'll let myself check Facebook. Seeing ""likes"" on Facebook posts gives me a rush of dopamine. The dopamine becomes the reward from my having done 15 pull-ups.""It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds.""This book helps you get where you want to be by helping you establish routines where you are today. Focus on the habit and eventually you'll find you've arrived at your goal.4.5 stars out of 5. As a caveat, I find these types of habit books more readily embraced by men than women. My observation is that men have an easier time being rote in their habits; eating the same meals every day (requiring the same preparation, same shopping list, same routine every time). This book had a rather un-emotional feel to it like many other books by men talking about habits and optimization (ie: Tim Ferriss).

  This book came to me as amazon recommended. I thought, oh great, another book on building good habits. But I took a glance at it, and decided to look deeper, so I bought a copy. It completely changed my thinking about setting and focusing on goals. I had fallen into the same trap the author writes about. I would set an ambitious goal, with no particular system for achieving that goal. I wasn't consistent about my goals. Sometimes I did the small 1% steps to get to the goal, other times I would do something a few times and give up. It was purely by chance whether I would stick to something or not. What I've learned from the book is to be systematic about my approach. Even more important to to align my identity to the goal I want to achieve.

  For those who are at times weak-willed creatures of habit vs. logic (like me), this book is life-changing.  As a general rule you know something is spot-on when it had never occurred to you before, but after reading it, it just seems so obvious.  This book is focused mainly on 1) on setting up systems such as your environmental factors of how you make good or bad habits easier or harder for yourself [e.g. having potato chips in plain view on the counter, or putting your workout clothes out the night before] and 2) how to identify habits, set up goals and hold yourself to them.  I haven't achieved every single habit goal yet, but 6 months after finishing the book I've lost 30 pounds and re-instilled a handful of key good habits that I'd been wanting to get back to for years.

  I like many folks in life have been trying to change things up in my life. This desire for change has picked up greater urgency given the global pandemic. A lot of people are like myself looking at the pandemic and questioning the direction of their life. That’s the mindset in which I decided to read Atomic Habits. From the opening pages, it explodes the conventional mindset a lot of people myself included have that change has to be this big process.The relentless theme of atomic habits is that change is actually a more incremental process and that you are more likely to make the meaningful change if you change one little thing and then carefully add another and another until you don’t even think about doing these things. Eventually if you act with a goal in mind (whatever it is), you will discover that through a series of little changes built upon you are in a much better place regarding your goals and objectives.Atomic Habits really demystified change and reduced it from a thousand pound gorilla and made it more like a seventy-five pound German Shepard Mix. The big thing with change is the mental aspect and I think by following the premise of just doing a little bit, people will have much better results for the longer term. There’s really nothing that’s revolutionary or beyond intuition here, but sometimes the reminder helps.

  In short: I expected a lot - and I got it. :)Simple in content, not much new under the sun - but very clear and most of all actionable.Since I am a strong believer of the power of habits, this is a book I will keep rereading once in a while. Most refered books and authors were well known for me, but this does not take away the achievement of the author - who summarizes everything in a crisp and ""easy-to-put-into-practice"" way. This has NOT been done before by the other authors.I already made some changes, and reinforced some simple atomic habits, while reading te book.Congrats James, you have done well and created a very useful book for your followers.

  I liked the main idea of the book about focusing on the main thing that needs to be done and letting the other things go. I also appreciated the discussion about the kinds of changes and kinds of habits that could be made (whether it is something you do or something you are).  So the first half of the book seemed really solid and explained a good approach to making incremental changes in your life.  After that, I found the book got distracted from the main theme.  There was discussion about the one thing in this aspect of your life and the one thing in another aspect of your life.  It seemed to me that this violated the overall thesis of the book.  I was somewhat disillusioned with the overall book as I got deeper into it.  But I recommend the book for its overall thesis and making the point about incremental change and focus,

  I’ve followed James Clear’s blog for some time now, and he has always been a very easy read. I love similar content to what he writes about, so he is essentially a “shortcut” to learning since he is a more voracious reader/learner than I.I enjoyed this book and think James did a wonderful job piggy-backing off his well-read background while retaining his own unique voice. This was not someone regurgitating what other people have written, but rather him taking all that he has learned and formulating it into a completed puzzle for our consumption.One thing that is tricky with books like this is that they are so easy to read that sometimes you forget they are only useful if you stop, think, and implement the suggestions into your day-to-day. Some books are more about insights and paradigm shifts, while I would say this book is one to study and be disciplined about applying to gain ultimate value from.

If was can understand the Laws of Good Habit Building (Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, and Satisfying).  For breaking bad habits (Make it Obscure, Ugly, Difficult, and Painful), you can also combine the two to help motivate you in the right direction.  Wonderful, practical tactics for changing human behavior.  Second, it allows for greater understanding of the ""Effects of accumulation results of marginal gains""  If you can improve 1% per week, in a year, you will have improved over 50% which means a fundamental change in who you are in most cases.  You have to set up systems to achieve your goals.  Prepare of unforeseen challenges that LIFE will throw at you.  Prepare three meals at one time, so you only have ONE major clean up instead of three.  Have mini meals ready so when you are hungry, you still stay on plan for your total caloric intake for the day.  It's NOT the goals, but the systems you setup for yourself that determine your success.  When you are about to make a poor food choice, you can ask yourself, ""Would a health person eat this?""  If the answer is no, than you are re-enforcing your identity and goals of a healthy person you wish to become.

I have been studying Italian, working out, saving money, reading, writing, practicing the Alexander Technique, etc. all of it on a consistent basis for the last 3 months! before I read the book, I had the intention to succeed in everything I started, but I always ended up quitting. As he explains it in the book, it was all about the system I was using. Whenever I started something new, I was trying to kill it from the beginning, and I just got myself worn out quickly. Everything I mentioned above, I started doing it for no more than 5 minutes a day, and then I just add it a minute every month. By itself, a minute is not much, but after a few months, I started to feel the difference. I used to wonder what was wrong with me! I wanted to start and finish things, especially studying languages, since I love speaking different languages. I got excited for the first few days, and then quit. Not anymore!

  “Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones”by James Clear is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their career, life, or how they can turn their bad habits into good ones. As a person who is very organized and detailed when it comes to work, life, and recreation before reading this book, I learned many valuable techniques to continue working on my own atomic habits.I loved the graphs used throughout this book as it helps to visualize how impactful habits are and why it’s important to stick with them over time. It was also great to read the real-life stories around athletes, celebrities, and even comedians on how having good habits and building upon them are truly a recipe for continued growth and maintaining long-term success.I give “Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones”by James Clear a 5/5 as this book has definitely helped me and countless others when it comes to good habits. If you’re looking for a great resource guide on creating your own atomic habits, breaking bad ones, and maximizing them towards being the very best version of yourself you can be, I’d highly recommend this book!

  I have been a subscriber of James Clear's newsletter for at least 3 years now, and I find his content very helpful. When he announced that he is going to write a book about habits, I got really excited.It is the first book I ever read this year and it was perfect. It's what I needed.The difference with this book from the others is that there are a lot of ACTIONABLE steps that are provided. Seriously... it's not just a one kind of way to do things, but it's about finding what will work for you in your lifestyle.I got the hard copy first, and when I got done reading the book, I got a kindle version as well for reference. After all, this not a one and done book. It's something that you can go back to over and over.I'll go out of my way by saying that if you want a book about HABITS, this is the only one you really need. You can go read the other popular books if you want to have a lot of scientific explanation, but this book offers enough of that already but more of actionable steps. This is just based on my experience with the book of course. If you like other books better, then that's cool too.Thanks James for writing this book.

  Excellent book to read and powerful if you apply it.  The author is clearly an expert at habits.  He uses research, personal experience and fascinating stories to convince us that if we want to change following the advice in Atomic Habits will get us there.An atomic habit is small daily habit with results similar to compound interest.He draws on science from biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, cognitive and behavioral science and more.  He offers us wisdom and practical advice that follow his four-step model of habits, cue, craving, response and reward.  He reviews each step with stories and practical advice.  He shows how to move toward good habits and away from bad habits.I was assigned to read this book as part of a positive psychology master’s class. Here’s a summary of my report on the fourth step, he calls them laws.  The fourth law is to make is satisfying to move towards a good habit and make it unsatisfying to move towards a bad habit.  The amazing story he tells to support this habit is about handwashing.  When Safeguard soap made the experience of handwashing pleasant, nice feel and smell, in Pakistan the overall health improved as more people washed their hands longer.  The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent and pneumonia by 48%.  He explains how atomic habits helped the Lakers become the powerhouse NBA team in the eighties, how Chris Rock and Steve Martin became top rated comedians, and why MichaelPhelps genes and habits matter to make him an Olympic Medalist.It’s entertaining, well written and inspiring to read.  More importantly it’s about taking positive action.

  I picked this book up because one of the podcasters I listen to, Corinne Crabtree, raved about it and everyone in our Facebook group who picked it up was talking about how great it was. I meant to just take a quick look at the first few pages because I was still in the middle of two other books but Clear's style of writing was so engaging I couldn't put it down.As I was reading I marked down many lines that really resonated with me including ones like ""Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results."". He goes on to talk about how it's usually the system you need to tweak to create habits in order to reach your goals. Subconsciously I realized this but I never really actively thought about it and how I can actively try and tweak my mini-habits to accomplish the things I wanted.I love that at the end of each chapter there is a wrap up of the key points covered in that chapter. He also shows how each of his points layer on top of each other and work together. Great read that I highly recommend!

Truthfully, I wasn’t sure how much “new” material I was going to get out of Atomic Habits, but it came so highly recommended that I gave it a read. I’m glad I did. James has done a phenomenal job of synthesizing the research and prior work done in the field of habit formation. Additionally, he has a knack for creating memorable frameworks that make it relatively easy to apply the lessons into daily life.

  I've read a ton of non-fiction and business minded books and they all seem to have the secret to getting more out of your life, your business, your relationships, etc. That's all well and good, but the most effective changes - coincidentally - may in fact take the least amount of brainpower. They come in the form of habits, ways our brain have been wired to do things naturally and without thinking, and more importantly, small, daily or near-daily actions that trigger reward centers in our brain.Unfortunately, most of the habits we possess or continue to do are unhealthy or destructive. I.e. chewing nails, eating junk food, or just coming home and watching TV or mindlessly browsing YouTube or scrolling through Instagram. We do these things not because we're weak willed or lazy (most of the time), but because they're the easiest habits to fall into. They're specifically designed and tailored to affect the reward centers of our brain and deliver scheduled shots of dopamine, thus turning them into habits that are hard to kick.Atomic Habits, in a brilliant and knowledgeable way I think, breaks down the ways we can actually achieve more by doing less. And by less, I mean having to expend less effort in willpower, pain, or sacrifice than we're lead to believe. A perfect example in this book is this dancer (I'm forgetting her name) who's world renown and a master of her craft, and who doesn't have to remind herself to go to the gym every day. She instead views the act of going to the gym as walking out her door and hailing a cab to the gym. Once she's done that, everything else takes care of itself. So the habit is not working out, expending sweat, effort, and feeling tired or worn out, which is what many of us find challenging. All she has to do is hail that cab, and she's done, because once she's there she begins to work out. The difference is small, but releases this ability to get that daily workout in which is essential to her success.That's one example of many in this book that challenges one's thinking of how to be successful and create good habits. It's easy to believe it's all a matter of will, of getting motivated, of working off a spark of passion, etc. The truth it is has much more to do with routine, pleasure, familiarity, and route action. I highly recommend this book.

Using ideas like ""Make it obvious"" I leave my exercise equipment where I will see it immediately to use at the right time. I ""make it easy"" by just doing 2 minutes of the dreaded exercise which has spurred me on to many more minutes of doing what I need to do. It's pushed over into my work habits and got me standing every hour at my desk and walking on my breaks by using prompts on the computer. These things alone made it worth the price.

  I would go so far as to say that ""Atomic Habits"" is the most important book in the genre of Personal Development. I own dozens of personal development books and I can say without hesitation; this is the ONE book that will actually deliver the transformation you are seeking.  James Clear does an excellent job of explaining how your ""habits"" dictate your ""outcomes"".""Atomic Habits"" clearly illustrates WHY you do the things you do.  More importantly, James Clear will show you how to transform your life with small (seemingly insignificant) changes in your daily behavior (your habits).  You will understand how these ""small changes"" will eventually compound into remarkable results.Buy this book, but don't just read it... STUDY IT... IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT! You will come away with many ""aha"" moments.I should mention at this junction that I have no affiliation with James Clear -- other than being a huge fan of his teachings. If you're looking for transformation, ""Atomic Habits"" will deliver.

  I've always been a goal-oriented person and, for the most part, I achieve my goals. But it wasn't until I read James Clear's book, <i>Atomic Habits</i>, that I realized why — I have intuitively built habits to support achieving my goals. And I was more focused on the activities I needed to do on a regular basis than the end goal itself. So that even if I didn't achieve my ultimate goal by a timeframe I had set for myself, I always made progress.But I had not done this consciously. Now, after reading this book, I have a full toolset of principles and tips to help me create the life I want to live and be the person I want to be.Clear's methods and principles are not new.

  By save my life, I really mean GIVE ME a life. After a terrible accident in 2015, I’ve been unable to “reach my potential” as the author talks about after his own major injury.Mine, too, was a brain injury. I’ve been unable to maintain any sort of gainful employment, or other kind of occupation to fill my days. Fortunately I have the support of others. I’ve begun implementing some of this book’s recommendations for building small habits for big effects. It’s true. It is my most useful tool right now.After having “NO LIFE” since 2015, I finally feel in control of building toward a rich and full, gratifying life.As of now, I just had my first day volunteering at an animal shelter. Using this as a way to fill my days, it also gives me a sense of purpose and use my compassion in a big way.Without building the small habits that led me to feel that I could take on this venture, I likely would never have taken the first step.Thanks. I’m building my life again.

  I love habits and the science surrounding them. This book is a practical ""how-to"" guide, a habit manual if you will. You can break bad habits and form good ones. The concepts in this book work and have the potential to change your life when properly applied. Very well written - superbly organized and easy to understand. Well worth the price of admission. Will be gifting this book to my children (1 gift of 3 complete as of this writing).

  Having listened to the audio version of Atomic Habits, I must say that James Clear is now a master of understanding habit formation and change. Atomic Habits is destined to be the bible for all who want to understand this important life skill. Clear writes clearly (pun intended) and has a lot to say. Unlike many books in the self-improvement domain, Atomic Habits is worth the a full commitment to study the entire book and put it into practice. It's an impressive piece of work.

  Excellent breakdown of habit information and tips. Really like this book for how actionable it is. It's a road-map to creating (and eliminating) habits. I've read it twice. The first time it helped it view myself and my interactions with the world a little differently. It brought awareness to me. I re-read it about 4 months later once I had internalized it and was sure about what things I wanted to change in my life. I put many new mental models into action and it has helped me create new habits and finally beat some bad ones.Highly recommended. Should be a baseline book for anyone interested in becoming better.

  Sometimes, when I pick up a book, I’m lucky that the universe has sent the book my way for answers that I was looking for or help I needed.

  This book has changed my life in a profound way, primarily through the the new habits that I formed that have a positive impact on my everyday life.As you probably know, it is not the habit itself that we need, because we all know the kinds of things that we should do (eat healthy, exercise more, etc.), but that doesn't mean that we have the motivation to start those habits and to stick with them.This books has very helpful information on how to establish a habit and keep it going.  It also helps you to build habits on top of each other, and defines which habits will give you the greatest impact in building subsequent habits.Some of the insight from this book has helped me with fitness, emotional health, life systems and organization, and strengthening my discipline to create new habits.Highly recommended.  If you don't get several actionable insights out of this book then I would be shocked.

There are some excellent principles presented that are very unique and extremely practical.The author does a great job presenting the steps needed for real permanent change as he shows you so many examples.

  This is not a book to read once for fun and then stick it on the shelf.Don’t get me wrong, it’s a terrific read with fascinating stories, examples, and research. (The author’s personal story, which involves a horrifying incident with a baseball bat, gets you turning pages fast.)But the real value is in what you can do with what you learn.I’ve been reading James Clear's blog for a while and was fortunate to get advance access to the book. I’ve gone through it three times already. Took copious notes. Started implementing the techniques. And it’s powerful stuff.Don’t be fooled by the topic — “habits” sounds a bit dreary.But the book is not about figuring out how to plod through life, getting rid of those pesky habits like smoking and getting better at good habits like eating your vegetables.It’s about figuring out what you want to do within your time constraints — what you want to do with your life — and setting up systems that improve your chances of becoming the person you want to be.So buy it, read it, study it, and make these simple techniques part of your life. They’re kinda fun — and there’s no telling how far your habits will take you.

  Clear provides the reader with some practical ways to build and maintain habits. I especially like that he provides four clear ways to build and maintain good habits, while offering four ways to break bad habits we all tend to build over time. A few other takeaways for me. First, the importance of habit stacking. Clear suggests building habits in a way that one action triggers another. Bedtime routines are an example of this. I have implemented this in my own routine and it has been helpful. The chapter that discussed building in accountability for your habits was also helpful. Though the example he provided was extreme (a guy entered a pretty stringent “contract” with his wife and trainer), I can see how accountability can help with habits. Overall, a good read on creating and sustaining habits.

  Some parts could have been more scientific. Author probably kept it simple for more people to understand. Author’s narration of his story was humble and inspiring. I disagree with how Karachi was depicted in this book. There were generalizations in description. Even though author was discussing a neighborhood of the city it appeared as though the entire city is was like that. To be honest, this description kind of hurt the credibility of the rest of the book. The book was otherwise thorough more or less. There was no fluff unlike some other books.

  I have a lot of bad habits and thought I would give this book a try.  I was first very surprised by how the book started out and the background of the author.  He drew me in with this real-life situation.  I found that my habits can be changed.  His suggestion was to stop setting goals and create small habits that align with your identity and who you want to become.  This will help reach your end result.  So, if your previous mind set was to have a goal to lose weight you should now be wanting to identify as a healthy person.  Then you would create habits like walking so many steps each day, drinking 8 glasses of water each day, or 20 minutes of exercise each day.  Create these habits and then increase the habits over time.  Therefore, walk 200 steps or less starting out and increase overtime until you get to 6,000 more per day.  Now you have a good habit, and the result will be you losing weight but more importantly being a healthier person.  I like this idea because he said habits are the systems needed to lead us to the results we want.  Sometimes we have the wrong systems and don’t see results fast enough and then quit. Bad behaviors repeat themselves not because you don't want to change, but because you're using the wrong system.In the book he also explains that getting 1 percent better every day can add up over time.  I think this is important to those of us who feel like they are not seeing results fast enough.  We need to stick to those good habits. If you're willing to continue with little, seemingly insignificant changes for years, they will compound into extraordinary benefits. The book talks about behavior change at the identity level.  It also talks about habit stacking.  A simple concept to help create better habits.  The book states that any habit may be looked at in a four-step feedback loop: cue, craving, response, and reward.  These are steps to help build good habits as well as how to break the bad ones.  The book gives a set of rules to help change our behaviors and build better habits that include (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.  I found this very informative and hope to be on my way to break down my own bad habits and build a good habit in its place.  I hope to use more of these techniques talked about in this book to improve my habits.  I would highly recommend this book.

  The book is not bad. I really got the impression that the author put some good amount of effort writing it and, most importantly, he seems to believe in what he is writing. However, it builds mostly on things which are really obvious for someone who is more than 30 yo and is already after education and has got a job, family etc. In one way of another, I think that everyone is already applying the ""techniques"" from this book in their daily life without thinking about it. While reading I recognized things which I do a few times, but never really had the ""aha!"" moment.

  Like many other people , i'm a hardcore procrastinator that would get pumped up and motivated to change my life but eventually get burned out after a couple of weeks of non-stop work when that motivational 'high' wears off . I've lost weight multiple times in the past but only to regain it all back. While some of the concepts in the book aren't new , i've read similar books such as 'Mini Habits' by Stephen Guise , 'The Slight Edge' by Jeff Olson and Kaizen Way by Dr Robert Maurer. Atomic Habits are all those books put together on steroids.James Clear explains how setting goals are not the answer but you should focus on  'systems' instead. The system is simply to repeat good habits everyday by making them easy to do, attractive and rewarding.  Yes it will take some time to see big results but the upside is that they stick for good.I learned how to code ,play the guitar and lost more than 100 pounds thanks to Atomic Habits.

  James Clear first came to my attention when an article of his on Pat Reilly’s Lakers analytics was posted to Hacker News. I knew then that I wanted to hear his take on systems thinking, whenever it might be the case that he would have a book ready for public consumption. The result is that, although very little in this short book is wholly original, Clear has done a tremendous service to his readers through his thorough research sorting the wheat from the chaff in the crowded field of behavior modification research. But beyond merely providing a model for habits, Clear has peppered Atomic Habits with actionable tactics. There are also a few diagrams illustrated in this book which I am very thankful to have seen. All of this makes Atomic Habits a brilliant field manual — one which I recommend reading slowly and integrating fully.

  Many leaders and mentors say that first step of self-improvement is having an awareness. This book gave me a lot of awarenesses and step-by-step instruction to build habits to serve myself.

  James gives a very clear and analytical approach based on science and human evolution. I found the missing link in my own behaviors and I have been able to finally make lasting changes in my life.

  “Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.“This book is about strategically building your ideal life and your ideal self. It’s so easy to imagine how we wish our lives and ourselves were different, but when it comes to taking action, it can be almost paralyzing. We don’t know where to start, we have unconscious beliefs that sabotage ourselves at every turn, environments that no longer serve us, and action plans that lead to burn out, frustration, and backsliding. James’ book offers solutions to all of these problems. With a little clarity, patience and openmindedness, this book’s wisdom put to use will get you moving towards where you’d like to be.

  Totally a seminal work. First off when James talks about David Brailsford and how he turned around both the British Cycling National program and the Team Sky pro team, I was hooked. I am a cyclist and was keenly aware of Brailsford.I know the core ideas are mostly borrowed from existing sources. I know the data is all out there. What James Clear has done is a masterful job of packaging everything nto a format with the language, examples, and diagrams that make it all seem like I CAN DO THIS STUFF. I am already starting down a new road with much more conviction that I can change my life through small subtle changes.  Excellent book.

This book by James is a very simple and practical assessment of the effects of habits and how to build new good habits and get rid of old bad ones. There is a lot of important information provided through the use of anecdotes and the science of habits but James has managed to keep the writing simple and easy to follow.

  Atomic Habits is a life changing book. Being someone who has always been passionate about the future and achieve rare forms of success, I always had the issues of not understanding the next step. The accomplishments  that I personally strive for are not the average profession. My personal issues of getting ""stuck"" happen because I could not find the next step. The old saying ""you do not have to recreate the wheel"" has always stuck with me. I now understand a way to create my own path using the strategies James Clear breaks down in Atomic Habits. This book has  and will continue to help my current buisness and help with my future passion. More importantly and unexpectedly has made me a better husband and father to my family.

  I am an avid reader of this type of book, yet it left me with nothing. It was one of the least informative nonfiction books I have read in years. I was skeptical of all the rave reviews and held off buying it for almost a year. I should have remained skeptical and saved my money. I couldn't really think of one thing I gained after closing it at the end. The biggest part of it, the habit loop, was explained so poorly that I didn't really grasp it yet alone try to incorporate it into my life. The Power of Habit is incredible. If you haven't read that yet, spend your money on that one and really get an education on what a habit is, how to create good ones and eradicate bad ones.

  James Clear explains very succinctly what the process of developing habits is.  He identifies how to take small steps, how to set goals and many other things.What is really important in his book as opposed to other books, is that he does not use jargon - it is a principle of writing that one does not use the word ""purchase"" if you can use ""bought"".  You do not use ""inextricably"" if you can use ""closely"".This is one of the reasons that his book is effective.  It also is also very logical and well structured which adds greatly to the way the book empowers people to develop habits.Its material is truly unique and highly useful.

  I initially avoided this book because I thought it would be a hassle to change and record habits. Too much effort...aren't I good enough already? But the whole point of this book is that small, atomic, painless changes can easily be incorporated into your life and pay long term dividends. There are great examples of this mindset, how it works, and you can do as little or as much as you want.

  Ok technically 40-50% of the actions we do are habits but think about it.

After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change, you are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.""  And ""It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins."" and finally to reinforce this point ""The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become"".Also, the author has developed a clear framework called 'The Four Laws of Behavior Change"" which provides a simple set of rules (laws) for creating good habits and breaking bad habits. And you are taken step by step through each law, given plenty of practical examples, and there is a summary at the end of each chapter which reinforces the main learning points.Thanks for writing this book Mr James Clear! It has helped me tremendously!

  Overall, I’m happy that I read this book. There were a few real reframes: “Every action you take is a vote for the identity you wish to have”, “Just get 1% better.”, “the habit isn’t going to the gym its getting in the cab” etc.Often, James would choose to describe his core principles with a drawing/visualization. I found these core tenants the real anchor of the book. I wouldn’t recommend this audible only for that reason.Why not 5 stars? Overall I found too many of the sections to be a bit “no duh”. Additionally, this could have been about 30% shorter, IMO. This felt like a Ted talk extended version...KDW

  This was one of the first books I read this year, and the best so far. I recall some of Clear's words on a daily basis. Most impactful of all were those that stopped me from giving up, after failing to uphold a habit after a period of adhering to it. That by adhering to a habit the majority of the time, I'm showing who I am. It's such a relief not to have to be perfect! I'm sticking to tracking my habits on a daily basis.

  As the title says, I think this is one of the best self-improvement books I’ve read in a while. It’s hard to say why exactly. I guess partly because the strategies the author suggests are so concrete and feasible. Nothing esoteric. I’ve still got a lot of work to do on improving my habits, but I think the best takeaway from this book is: don’t aim to be perfect, aim to be consistent. It’s okay if you miss a day.

  I really enjoyed this book. The way the chapters are broken down make it easy to get thru day by day. Oftentimes we don’t follow thru on our good habits because we can’t execute them perfectly and this book puts that into perspective and eases the tension. I found several concepts in this book to be easily implemented into life immediately to make a change. I’ll add this book to my lifetime reading list that I’ll read several times thru and will recommend to others when I can. Great job James Clear!

  Clear explains why we persist in undesirable behaviors and then shows how to flip the game of life.

In your normal life you always have habits (bad habits, including browsing social media, watching TV...) and the tips in the book show you how to try to avoid bad habits while it shows you how to create incentives for good habits.

  Like others who have written reviews I have followed James Clear since he started his blog and find his style of writing appealing because it’s “clear” (no pun intended), pragmatic and believable because he has “clearly” (again, no pun intended) done his homework and thoroughly researched the ideas he presents. Also, like other reviewers, I have read A LOT about habits, behavior change and I’m familiar with premises behind the tiny changes and habit stacking models. When James announced his book release I was excited for his accomplishment and admittedly a bit dubious about what new idea could he possibly add.  I like this guy and he does practice what he preaches but what else can you add to developing positive habits that’s not already been said. Well, after reading Atomic Habits I can honestly say that James Clear has not only added quite a lot but did so in an engaging, enjoyable manner that includes relevant stories and examples.  If you are seeking to change or improve habits then please do yourself a favor and read this book.  Seriously you won’t need all the other books because this one has covered an exhaustive amount of research and makes it easy for you to understand how to change your habits (hint: it’s not you —it’s your system)
